00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,927
(man) Why do you keep
looking out the window, Will?

3
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:13,013
You like the snow?

4
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:20,771
You know, for some people,
snow brings on a very specific feeling.

5
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,355
Uh, some love it.

6
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:29,279
It feels clean and pure, like a...
fresh start or a beginning.

7
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,741
For others, it's frightening.

8
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,246
Cold and silent and... isolating.

9
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,251
What are you thinking about
when you look at the snow?

10
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:46,005
That I'm gonna have to shovel it.

11
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,339
(soft chuckle)

12
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,974
Will, I'm gonna talk to you...
like I would talk to an adult,

13
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,143
because I think
you're a very intelligent young man

14
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:03,147
and you are capable
of understanding what I'm saying.

15
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,153
In group dynamics, there's something
psychologists call "savior behavior."

16
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:11,237
Often one person in the group feels...

17
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:15,659
like they need to save the others
from a threat or an emotion

18
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,703
that he or she believes is dangerous.

19
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:25,335
Sometimes those people... are children
of parents with drug and alcohol problems.

20
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,839
These people have had to...
save themselves

21
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,258
from the emotional consequences
of their parents' addiction.

22
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,349
Your father was unable
to find Sara Patrell

23
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,309
and you wanted to help him, didn't you?

24
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:46,190
And that's a perfectly
normal response, Will.

25
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,275
You wanted to help,
that's a good thing.

26
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:55,532
But sometimes when we try to help
one person, another person gets hurt.

27
00:03:56,575 --> 00:04:00,286
Sometimes that person's ourselves,
sometimes it's someone else.

28
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,541
And I know your intentions...
weren't to hurt anyone,

29
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,002
but when you say you can see Sara...

30
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,923
or her ghost and talk to her,

31
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:13,175
it causes people a lot of pain.

32
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,720
Especially Sara's parents,

33
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:21,558
who are dealing with the worst thing
a parent can go through.

34
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,025
Now, I've been as honest
as I can with you, Will.

35
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,362
Can you do the same for me?

36
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:41,954
Are you still seeing Sara?

37
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,379
Shh.

38
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,676
No.

39
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,637
- (intercom dings)
- (woman) Welcome to Iceland.

40
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,015
Please remain seated with your seat belts
fastened until we reach the gate,

41
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,060
and the captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

42
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:11,024
(Riley panting)

43
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:18,907
Oh... I'm so cold.

44
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:21,160
Mm.

45
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,455
- It's as high as it'll go.
- (exhales)

46
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:27,415
(Magnus) Here...

47
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:29,709
take my coat.

48
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:33,337
(gasps, exhales)
No, no, no, no, no, you need that.

49
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:36,633
I'm hot-blooded.
Don't worry.

50
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,927
I want to keep you both warm.

51
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,470
Here.

52
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,266
(gasps, cries out)

53
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:46,977
- Oh, it hurts! A lot.
- I know.

54
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,105
(sighs) They're coming faster. Oh...

55
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,318
Don't worry, sweetie, I'll get us there.
Just-- Just hang on.

56
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,489
(wind howling)

57
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,788
(groaning, inhales sharply)

58
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,207
(groans)

59
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,709
What were we thinking with that midwife?

60
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,502
It was a stupid mistake.

61
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:16,840
No, it's not her.
It's me. It's the hex.

62
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:20,844
- I'm hexed. (panting)
- I've told you, it's not the hex.

63
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,386
You're magic.

64
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,890
You're the most magical thing

65
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,766
- that has ever happened to me.
- (laughs)

66
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,395
I'll get us there, I promise.

67
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,190
(cries out)

68
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,733
(both gasp)

69
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:36,943
(Riley gasps)

70
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:40,989
(Riley cries out)

71
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,118
(Riley screams)

72
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,501
(wind howling)

73
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:04,428
(Magnus whispers) Riley.

74
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,932
Magnus.

75
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:11,270
Riley... come with me.

76
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,230
(gasps softly)

77
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,862
Magnus? (panting)

78
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:23,531
(moans)

79
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,243

80
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,961

81
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,213
(gasps, panting)

82
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,507
Magnus...

83
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,760
Magnus.

84
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,597
(whimpers, sobs)

85
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,100
Magnus... no.

86
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,233
Magnus...

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,823
Oh, no.

88
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,367
(sniffling)

89
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:09,119

103
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,552
Oh, my LÃºna.

104
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:50,845
My LÃºna.

105
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:56,101
(sniffling) Someone's coming for us.

106
00:09:58,478 --> 00:09:59,645
It'll be OK.

107
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,481
(whispers) Someone's coming.

108
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,986
(sighs) Will.

109
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,282
(whispers) I'm coming for you.

110
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,334
I have bad news and worse news.

111
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,628
- Start with the bad.
- I found out where they're taking her.

112
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:26,298
A research facility
controlled by BPO up the coast.

113
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,673
- That's good.
- Not really.

114
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,676
It's very heavily secured,
but I'm working on a way in.

115
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:33,930
OK, give me the worse news.

116
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:35,974
A private plane
was just cleared for landing

117
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:38,768
with a single passenger on board,
Dr. Ellison.

118
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,270
- Whispers.
- It's gotta be him.

119
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:41,938
- I'm ahead of him.
- Not for long.

120
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,399
A helicopter is there
waiting to pick him up.

121
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,611
- I'm gonna need some transportation.
- Car's just confirmed.

122
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,028
It's there.

123
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,076
- Are you Will Gorski?
- Yes, I am.

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,328
Welcome to Iceland.

125
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,079
Please, sign here.

126
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,665
When did I get expensive taste?

127
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:02,875
When I got access
to Metzger's credit cards.

128
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,835
Ha!

129
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:05,253
Enjoy the stay.

130
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,715
The facility isn't on any map,

131
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,469
but I've loaded the coordinates
into the GPS.

132
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,220
It says that you can be there in 20.

133
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,930
- I'll be there in ten.
- (engine revs)

134
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,103
(breathes heavily)

135
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,855
(wind howling outside)

136
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,898
(gasps)

137
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,821

138
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:46,878

00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,481
(grunting)

141
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,068
(cries out)

142
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:13,029
(panting)

143
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:22,414
(shrieks, gasps)

144
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:24,957
(grunts)

145
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:32,382
(groans)

146
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:42,267
(sings softly in Icelandic)

147
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,919
(sings in Icelandic,
voice quavering)

148
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:42,910
(stops singing)

149
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,668
(gasping)

150
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:02,514
(whispers) I'm sorry.

151
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,686
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:13,566
I'm so sorry.

153
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,404
(whispers) I won't leave you.

154
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,284
(sniffling)

155
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,245
I promise I won't leave you.

156
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:26,723
My baby... where is she?

157
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:32,144
(Yrsa)
You would have done anything for her.

158
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:37,525
You would have
given your life for your baby.

159
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,861
(whispers) Yes.

160
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,032
This... is your last chance.

161
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,077
Take it.

162
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
Protect them.

163
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,297
(overlapping shouts)

164
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:01,716
Riley.

165
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,301
(panting)

166
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:16,898
(Yrsa, echoing) Protect them.

167
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,495
(Will) Riley...

168
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:33,706
please don't do it.

169
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,918
I'm coming for you.

170
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,219
Don't give up.

171
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,152
(gasping)

172
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:07,991
(groaning)

173
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,121
(exhales)

174
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:22,547
(Jonas) It might be the best thing
that could've happened.

175
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,048
Why?

176
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,718
She'll be unconscious
when Whispers arrives.

177
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:27,802
Where is he now?

178
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,347
He just climbed into the helicopter.
He knows you're here.

179
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:33,307
Do you have a plan for getting in?

180
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm going with a nine-millimeter
tucked under my arm.

181
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,709
(Sergei) Buffie doesn't trust you.

182
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,336
He believes you know
what happened to Steiner.

183
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:07,675
I've been trying to call my son
since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.

184
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:20,438
Do you know where Steiner is?

185
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,190
I do.

186
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,859
Where?

187
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:29,280
You told me you didn't
want to choose between him or me.

188
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:31,240
Now you don't have to.

189
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:33,242
Where is my son?!

190
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:39,415
I'd give you details...
but you can ask him yourself very shortly.

191
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:40,666
What?

192
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:43,711
You fuck! (grunts)

193
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:18,412
Careful.

194
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,039
I heard the shots.

195
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:23,084
I know the way a bullet sounds
when it hits Kevlar.

196
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,170
The bodyguard's gun is gone.

197
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,095
You son of a bitch!

198
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:36,388
- (gunshots)
- Did you kill my son?

199
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:41,268
(gunfire continues)

200
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,862
(screaming)

201
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:53,447
Kill that fucking cunt!

202
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,162
(gunfire stops)

203
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:14,677
(screams)

204
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,762
(banging against door)

205
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,606
(clicking)

206
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:42,830
What is happening?

207
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:46,375
I guess I've come to say goodbye.

208
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,128
(rapid gunfire)

209
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:50,504
This was your plan?

210
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:53,007
How was I supposed to know
he'd be wearing a bulletproof vest?

211
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,926
Who wears a bulletproof vest in real life?

212
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,223
(banging against door)

213
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:02,641
What are you doing?

214
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,437
I'm not like Sun.
I do not know how to use my fists,

215
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,732
but... that doesn't mean
I don't know how to fight.

216
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,526
(bottles clattering)

217
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,987
(banging continues)

218
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:41,180
I am not ready to say goodbye.

219
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,111
Oh, fuck!

220
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:24,682
(groans)

221
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,772
(wood creaking)

222
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:36,110
(clicking)

223
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,704
(slams gun down)

224
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:50,958
Why, Wolfgang?

225
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,460
Why?

226
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:55,629
You're family.

227
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,049
We raised you.

228
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:04,263
What kind of man
betrays his own fucking family?

229
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:13,356
You said that you would have given
everything to know who killed my father.

230
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,986
I give you that gift.

231
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:32,208
(shouting)

232
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,792
(gasping)

233
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,467
(choking)

234
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,512
(groans)

235
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:47,848
(grunting)

236
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:52,644
- (Wolfgang grunts)
- (neck cracks)

237
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,260
Oh, God.

238
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:28,180
Why?

239
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:30,599
You know why.

240
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:33,269
You always knew.

241
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:37,815
And still, you did nothing.

242
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,777
Wolfgang, I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

243
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,029
I'm so sor-- sorry. I--

244
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:45,448
Please...

245
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:48,242
forgive me.

246
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:54,873
You said... your blood is in my blood.

247
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,501
So is his.

248
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:06,135
My father... was a monster.

249
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:09,930
And so are you.

250
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:11,723
And so am I.

251
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,107
(sighs)

252
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,826
That's why you have to marry Rajan.

253
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:37,166
(gun clatters)

254
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,345
- Damn it!
- (Nomi) Stop the car.

255
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,555
What?

256
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:34,181
- No, no, no. That's him.
- I know.

257
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:35,766
Whispers is going to get there first.

258
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:39,520
He's already told security to be
looking for you. You need a distraction.

259
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:40,729
Stop the car.

260
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:46,402
Engine's in the back.
Oil line's along the driver's side.

261
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,114
Pop the trunk.
Find the oil line.

262
00:26:50,197 --> 00:26:51,198
Break it.

263
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:53,367
- It'll destroy the car.
- I know.

264
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:56,161
It was Amanita's idea.
It's why we picked this car.

265
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:58,914
Men cannot stand
to see a beautiful car in trouble.

266
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:02,251
It's some kind of primal instinct.
Look at you, you're hesitating.

267
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:04,378
- It's a really nice car.
- See?

268
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,338
(sighs)

269
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,342
(hissing)

270
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:11,969
(tires squealing)

271
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,762
(Will)
What am I supposed to use to get away?

272
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:17,015
You're the one that jumped on
the first plane to Iceland without a plan.

273
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,226
We're working on an exit strategy.

274
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,187
How about this guy?
He's on vacation.

275
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:24,106
In the meantime,
I think we found a way inside.

276
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,775
We've been combing through
the employee records, looking for a shell.

277
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,361
- I'm cooking the ID now.
- (Nomi) We'll send it when it's crispy.

278
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:32,156
You should be able to wave your phone
and just walk right in.

279
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,240
Seriously?

280
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:34,866
It's a square-cube law thing.

281
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,330
Bigger and more high tech a company is,
the easier it is to use the front door.

282
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,795
What about Riley?

283
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,255
I assume since none of us can reach her

284
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,633
that she's still unconscious,
which means that she's safe.

285
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,510
Safe? Here?

286
00:27:56,972 --> 00:28:00,309
Could you explain the whole "don't look
him in the eye" bad guy thing again?

287
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,102
I--

288
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:03,812
I mean, 'cause I saw him.

289
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:07,441
I was afraid to look at him at first,
but... then I did.

290
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:10,319
Does that mean
he can see inside my mind now, too?

291
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,029
No, no, no. Jonas explained it.

292
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,864
- No, he's like us.
- He's sensate.

293
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:16,783
- He can only connect with other sensate.
- So she's safe.

294
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:22,623
Except for the fact that a man that uses
zombies to murder people knows who she is,

295
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:24,124
the police are looking for her,

296
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,544
she's using equipment
that could get her 20 years in prison,

297
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:29,171
all while aiding and abetting
her fugitive lover.

298
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,548
Is that what you mean by "safe"?

299
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,633
Hey, Nom, it's OK.

300
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,677
You love her a lot.

301
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:40,765
In my book...
safety's always been highly overrated.

302
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,980
- (sighs) Such a shame.
- It's a '14.

303
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:49,567
It's only a year old, man.

304
00:29:00,077 --> 00:29:02,246
Oh, hey, man. You've gotta see it.
It's totally fucked up.

305
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,330
(man) Oh, my God!

306
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,376
- I still got nothing here.
- It's on its way.

307
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,380
- You sure this is gonna work?
- (Nomi) It'll work.

308
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:14,550
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,677
Your name is Fred Sloughman.

310
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,802
Fred Sloughman.

311
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:19,513
Consolidated Medical Waste.

312
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:23,058
Consolidated Medical Waste,
here to check out your... medical waste.

313
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:24,893
- You been cleared?
- Yeah, right here.

314
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:28,980
(rapid beeping)

315
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,315
- It's not working.
- Step over here.

316
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,775
- (Will) I don't understand.
- Um...

317
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:33,402
Step to the side.

318
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:34,861
It's not working.

319
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:38,449
- It should.
- Um...

320
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,325
- Turn up the brightness.
- Just a second.

321
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,202
Try it again?

322
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,416
(beeps)

323
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,335
- Sorry.
- Technology, huh?

324
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:55,132
(exhales)

325
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,719
Her blood pressure's dropping.
I can barely read her heartbeat.

326
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:01,513
Riley, open your eyes.

327
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,892
When I give instructions,
I expect them to be followed.

328
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:09,229
She went berserk. She grabbed a gun.
I had to use Rocuronium to put her down.

329
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:11,064
I want this woman conscious
as soon as possible.

330
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:13,150
She's no use to me in this condition.

331
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,319
If we're not careful,
she could go into anaphylactic shock.

332
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,405
You didn't expect this, did you?

333
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:20,115
Have you made a mistake?

334
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:25,912
Wake her up, now.

335
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,210
(Will) This place is huge.

336
00:30:32,294 --> 00:30:34,421
- Know where she's being held?
- No.

337
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,881
- Why not?
- I'm not the Wizard of Oz.

338
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:39,802
I only have access to what's in their
computer system and she's not in here.

339
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,345
- How do I find her?
- (Lito) I'll find her.

340
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,554
Lito.

341
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:45,098
Don't worry.

342
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:46,684
- Do I know you?
- Yeah.

343
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:49,353
We had sex.

344
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,816
Wha-- Oh. Uh...

345
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:58,195
- (stammers) Eh... It-- That was--
- Very special.

346
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:01,740
Oh, hey... Uh...

347
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,785
We're on a clock here, fellas.

348
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:05,910
Follow me.

349
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:09,373
- How will you find her?
- It's a secret.

350
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,041
I'm very good at secrets.

351
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,754
(Lito) Oh, my God... what a day.

352
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:19,800
What a day.

353
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,261
(sighs)

354
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:25,889
- He can be difficult, can't he?
- (scoffs)

355
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,684
You mean Dr. Ellison?

356
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,732
He told me that I should
pay attention to you because...

358
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,442
he says you are very good.

359
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,277
He has a lot of respect for you.

360
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:42,155
Really?

361
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:44,157
(chuckles)

362
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,703
I thought he was about to fire me.

363
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:50,205
- Welcome to my daily life.
- (chuckling)

364
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:53,751
I don't know how you could stand it.

365
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,754
Well... the work is important.

366
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:58,797
Yeah, of course.

367
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:03,260
Once in a while, I get to meet someone
who understands... how hard this job is.

368
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:05,095
- Mm. Yeah, yeah.
- You know?

369
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:06,889
And who happens to be very...

370
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:10,392
very attractive.

371
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,147
(laughing)

372
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,862
(sighs)

373
00:32:22,696 --> 00:32:24,406
- I have to get back to work.
- Yeah.

374
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:25,866
- Bye.
- Bye.

375
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,911
- What room was she in again?
- Um...

376
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,371
- Sixth floor, 620.
- Oh, yeah.

377
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:38,086
Clever, Mr. Gorski.

378
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,881
We don't know how he got clearance.

379
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:42,633
Ms. Marks, no doubt.

380
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:44,301
How's that exit strategy coming?

381
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,970
- We're going to need some help.
- Whose help?

382
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:48,472
Mine.

383
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,726
What can you do to help us
without him knowing?

384
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,562
In 12 minutes,
an ambulance is going to arrive,

385
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,189
because someone who works here
is on our side...

386
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:00,901
and is right now
pretending to have a heart attack.

387
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:03,528
Where is Mr. Gorski?

388
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:07,073
Sneaking away behind you.

389
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:09,618
Double the security
around Ms. Gunnarsdóttir.

390
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:13,121
- Sweep the facility.
- Done.

391
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:15,165
I don't like games.

392
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:20,003
That's a pity. I love them.

393
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,177
- She's definitely on this floor.
- Got it.

394
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,972
- The ambulance just arrived.
- Shit! Four guards.

395
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,306
Is that all?

396
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,480
Whispers knows where you are.

397
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,857
Give him a message.

398
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,027
If he thinks he can stop us,
he's going to need a lot more men.

399
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,362
This area is off-limits.

400
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:48,615
- (Sun grunts)
- (man screams)

401
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,579
- (man shouts)
- Aah!

402
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:57,165
- (all grunting)
- (man yells)

403
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:02,170
(shouts, gasps)

404
00:34:21,732 --> 00:34:23,274
(Riley gasping)

405
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:59,227
(gasping)

406
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,720
Riley.

407
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,180
It's me.

408
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,851
(singing in Icelandic)

409
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:43,438
(whispers) Will...

410
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:03,708
Are you real?

411
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:13,927
Left. Go left.

412
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:23,061
I'm not gonna be able
to carry her out of here.

413
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,771
- We have to wake her up.
- How?

414
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:26,064
I don't know.

415
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:27,107
(Kala) I do.

416
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:29,192
(voice quavering) Set her down.

417
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:50,380
Sugammadex is the only
safe recovery agent for Rocuronium.

418
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,969
Combined with a little adrenaline...

419
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,893
This will be very violent,
but it'll wake her.

420
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,862
(gasping)

421
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:17,240
(whispers) Will.

422
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,201
- I'm here.
- (panting)

423
00:37:19,283 --> 00:37:21,703
- You shouldn't have come.
- Why?

424
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,997
Because everyone around me dies.

425
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:29,878
- (electricity surging)
- (groaning)

426
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:36,509
- (whimpering)
- Now... Shh.

427
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:40,055
- How are they planning on leaving?
- (grunts)

428
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,766
Ah.

429
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,935
The ambulance.

430
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,728
Ambulance is parked in the garage.

431
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:47,854
Take the elevator.

432
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:51,691
No guns.
I want them alive.

433
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,619
(elevator beeps)

434
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:24,348
What is it? What's wrong?

435
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,269
Hello, Will.

436
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:31,773
Oh, no.

437
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,150
(elevator beeps)

438
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:36,069
Hey! No one can leave this building. Stop!

439
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:37,779
(grunts)

440
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:42,075
(man moans)

441
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:54,462
Shit.

442
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,965
Keys. Keys, keys, keys, keys.
There's no keys.

443
00:38:57,757 --> 00:38:58,967
This is not a problem.

444
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,637
The Van Damn has been stolen many times...

445
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:06,891
and you learn many tricks...
in order to steal it back.

446
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:10,687
OK. Ah...

447
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:16,484
(engine starts)

448
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,735
Whoo!

449
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:18,945
Easy.

450
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,292
(helicopter blades whirring)

451
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,859
Will, this is foolish.

452
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,904
I see and hear
everything you see and hear.

453
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:07,202
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
whatever you think... I will be with you.

454
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:20,924
- Will... it's over. He's won.
- No.

455
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:24,594
You're afraid.

456
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,263
We're gonna get out of here.

457
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,557
There is absolutely nowhere to hide.

458
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,475
How are you supposed
to get away from a helicopter

459
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,186
when there's just one long road?

460
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,941
Oh, yeah, I got it. I got it!

461
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,985
- A weather map?
- Helicopters fly by sight.

462
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:42,279
They're not good in fog or rain.

463
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:45,282
The weather changes drastically
with altitude, to lose these guys,

464
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:48,159
- all they gotta do is head here.
- Oh, my God, I love you!

465
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:51,371
Will, up ahead there's a road to the left.
Take it.

466
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,126
(tires squealing)

467
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,928
Will?

468
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,653
Enough.

469
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,322
I know you.

470
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:29,242
You are a police officer.

471
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:31,244
You are sworn to protect people.

472
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,000
It's in your blood.

473
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,335
It's in your heart.

474
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:44,174
I know you won't kill us all.

475
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,179
You can't do it.

476
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:51,931
Maybe I can't...

477
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:54,100
but I know who can.

478
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,361
- (gasps)
- Pull up!

479
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,332
- Oh, no.
- What?

480
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,417
- We can't go this way.
- Why not?

481
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:22,712
Please, don't take me there,
not to those mountains.

482
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:25,089
- It's the only way.
- (gasping)

483
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:29,177
- Will, please go back.
- Why?

484
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,678
- Go back!
- We can't!

485
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:31,888
Please!

486
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,479
- (gasps, screams)
- (tires squealing)

487
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:43,525
(gasping) Oh, no.

488
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:50,740
- Oh, no, no, please don't take me back!
- Riley, what--

489
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:52,534
- (moaning)
- (Will) What is it? What's wrong?

490
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:54,369
(cries out)

491
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,246
(Riley yelling)

492
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,748
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

493
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:01,125
(Will gasping)

494
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:03,794
Oh, hurry up. (exhales sharply)

495
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:05,629
(groaning)

496
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:11,928
What? What's happening?

497
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:13,679
I don't know.
I can't reach either one of them.

498
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:16,933
They were there heading into the mountains
and... now they're gone.

499
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,358
(door opening)

500
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,445
(Will) Riley!

501
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:34,992
Riley!

502
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:37,787
(gasps)

503
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:42,125
Riley!

504
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:57,723
- (panting) Riley... are you OK?
- (sings softly in Icelandic)

505
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:00,477
Stay with me.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

506
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,437
We're gonna be all right.

507
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,566
I wish that were true.

508
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:11,654
But we both know it's not.

509
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,701
Listen to me, Will.
You have very little time.

510
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:20,704
Whispers is getting into a car.
He'll find you shortly.

511
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:25,084
Once he has you, it won't be long
until he finds the rest of your cluster.

512
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:27,337
There's only one way.

513
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,796
(echoes) Protect them.

514
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,758
It's the only way.

515
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:41,476
(Will sobs)

516
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,771
It's OK, Will.
I was supposed to die here.

517
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:12,131
No. No.

518
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:13,633
No.

519
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:15,677
(gun thuds)

520
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,292
Riley...

521
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:32,086
Whispers saw me.

522
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,755
He's in my head.

523
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:35,757
As long as I'm unconscious,

524
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,719
he can't see what I see.
That's why I shot up with all those drugs.

525
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:41,721
In a minute,
I'm gonna be unconscious.

526
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:47,184
Our only chance is if you get
in that ambulance and drive us outta here.

527
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:49,811
Riley...

528
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:52,440
if you don't...

529
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,985
we're all gonna die.

530
00:46:56,736 --> 00:46:58,070
(whispers) I can't.

531
00:46:59,196 --> 00:47:00,406
I can't.

532
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:05,953
I can't leave her.

533
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,248
Riley, please.

534
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,586
I'm so sorry, Will. I can't do it.

535
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,463
(sobbing)

536
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,516
I know how much it hurts.

537
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:31,646
I know you want to lay down here
and never get up again.

538
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,105
I know it, 'cause I feel it.

539
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,485
(sobs) I can feel it.

540
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:45,159
And that means that somehow,
somewhere...

541
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:51,457
you can feel what I'm feeling, too.

542
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:57,338
I love you.

543
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:02,510
That's why you can't give up.

544
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,515
I love you.

545
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:20,611
(whispers) I love you.

546
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:22,697
(softly) I love you.

547
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:27,660
(fading) I love you... I love you...

548
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:43,843
(sings softly in Icelandic)

549
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:59,108
(acoustic rock song plays)

550
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:07,116
Is he sick?

551
00:49:08,992 --> 00:49:10,244
No, he's OK.

552
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,962
Everything's OK.

553
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,176
(exhales)

554
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:34,936
(whispers) You did it.

555
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:38,314
You saved us.
