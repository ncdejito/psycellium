00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:05,882
(Abraham, voice echoing) Whenever I have
a difficult decision to make, I come here.

3
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:09,176
This place brings a clarity
to any decision.

4
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:43,479
"Is the Holocaust an aberration
or a reflection of who we really are?"

5
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,773
(children laughing,
chattering in distance)

6
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,650
Why is it so loud where you are?

7
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,361
It's Independence Day.

8
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,905
(chuckles)

9
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,698
What is best in life, huh?

10
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,493
I don't understand.

11
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,703
No, you wouldn't.

12
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:20,016
(laughter, indistinct chattering)

13
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:38,868
(Jonas) You look lost.

14
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,453
Why'd you do that?

15
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:43,998
- Do what?
- Leave.

16
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,291
I told you it was
not a mobile service, Will.

17
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,627
Connections are fragile things.

18
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,255
(monitor beeps steadily)

19
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,216
It doesn't take them long to respond.

20
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,384
Maybe you should find us
somewhere to talk.

21
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,099
(door opens)

22
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,416
It is extraordinary.

23
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:32,546
I have never experienced anything like it,
not in my 20 years since passing the bar.

24
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:36,759
Your father did everything
he said he was going to do, and more...

25
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:40,304
the court agreed to hear his testimony.

26
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:46,018
If the hearing goes well, I think I can
have you out of here in less than a week.

27
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,568
You have to agree to the procedure here.

28
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,624
What will happen to Joong-Ki?

29
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,377
(lawyer sighs)

30
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:16,173
The court was lenient on you
because you cooperated.

31
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:21,304
I suspect...
they will make an example of him.

32
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:23,388
If I were your brother...

33
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,684
I would be on the next plane
to somewhere far from Seoul.

34
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,766
I want to believe
that the past is done with us

35
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,560
the moment we are done with it.

36
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:34,293
(Steiner) What's up, Wolfman? Ooh...

37
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:38,463
- The fuck are you doing here?
- Down, boy. Down. (tsking)

38
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:41,758
I heard dear Dad came to see you.

39
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:45,262
He said you had yourselves
a real nice... man-to-man,

40
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,265
but, knowing you, cousin, like I do,

41
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:54,397
I figured you needed a little...
motivational... TED-type talk?

42
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,275
Now, first of all...

43
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,779
I love Felix.

44
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:08,202
It was really hard...
to watch what happened to him.

45
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:12,998
Even though I know
that he would agree when I say

46
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:15,625
that he did bring it upon himself.

47
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,840
But... I am pulling
for his total recovery.

48
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:26,262
In fact, I have some...
close friends that work here,

49
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,723
and I asked them
to keep an eye on him for me.

50
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,476
(chuckles) They did scare me a little

51
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,145
with all the talk
about the things that can go wrong

52
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,814
when someone like Felix
is trying to recover.

53
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,401
Like, they had one case recently

54
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:45,155
where someone got the wrong medicine,
and boom! (whispers) Dead.

55
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:52,121
Would be some kinda... bad luck
for old Felixer, after surviving all this.

56
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,706
Can we just fast-forward
to the end of this shit?

57
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,626
- You get the diamonds--
- (shouts) My diamonds!

58
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,296
And you give Felix and me a pass.

59
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,966
Well...

60
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,551
I'm a forward-looking person, Wolfie.

61
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,304
You gotta believe that.

62
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,347
I don't dwell on the past.

63
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:16,520
I get my rocks back,
and we all live happily ever after.

64
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,402
- It's Independence Day?
- Yeah.

65
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,404
My parents were from India.

66
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:28,240
I was born there, but they moved to London
when I was a baby.

67
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,909
In my 20s, I moved to New York.

68
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:35,539
I never fully grasped
where I owed my allegiance.

69
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,625
Didn't know what I was supposed to sing.

70
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,629
The Indian national anthem? America's?

71
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,256
"God Save the Queen"?

72
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:50,346
I envy people their clear-cut allegiances.

73
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,516
Yeah, my dad's like that.

74
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:56,352
One beer, he's hammering the world
into two different sides,

75
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,687
Bears or Packers, us or them.

76
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,399
He's more right than he knows.

77
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:06,820
When you said that we're not like them,
did you mean we're not human?

78
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,322
What is human?

79
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:13,910
An ability to reason? To imagine?
To love or grieve?

80
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:19,416
If so, we are more human
than any human ever will be.

81
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,549
What troubles you?

82
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:32,679
It's all right.

83
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:35,849
Say what's on your mind.

84
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,566
For some time now...

85
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:50,447
I've been... confused about the wedding.

86
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:53,409
I know.

87
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,375
The police wanted to know
why Papa-ji was at the temple.

88
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,048
Since he's a non-believer,
I assume to see you.

89
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,008
Did he tell you why?

90
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,889
Manendra said that...
he was reconsidering our marriage.

91
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:20,143
Ah... I see.

92
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:24,189
So did you tell the police?

93
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:25,524
No.

94
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:30,779
- Why not?
- Because I haven't told Rajan.

95
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,619
Because you are
still confused about the wedding.

96
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,330
More confused than ever.

97
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,751
Well, you have to wonder,
if Manendra changed his mind,

98
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,170
why did he come to you
instead of his own son?

99
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:52,926
Perhaps because he knew
his own son wouldn't listen to him.

100
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,970
This was a love marriage, after all.

101
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:58,348
But it's possible that Rajan
will now have a different reaction

102
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:02,769
if it turns out that
this is his father's very last wish.

103
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:08,066
By telling Rajan now,
you will actually empower his father,

104
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,197
giving him more control over Rajan's life
than he had while he was alive.

105
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,952
(sighs) Interesting.

106
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,668
The simple solution
would be to tell the truth...

107
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:29,129
and let the chips fall where they may.

108
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:32,466
But if this marriage
holds the possible future

109
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,677
of a long and happy life together,

110
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,763
is it right to let a dominating man
take that away from you?

111
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:44,645
And yet, to not tell Rajan is to build...
whatever happiness you might find

112
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,563
upon a secret.

113
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,527
(sighs softly)

114
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,029
Not an easy decision, to be sure...

115
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:59,242
but one that I know
you already have the answer for.

116
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,423
Years ago... I was on your side
of this conversation,

117
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:16,885
and the man in my place
was the father of our cluster.

118
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:20,263
He was telling me all sorts of bullshit
about the psycellium,

119
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,391
about how he could feel
from this present moment

120
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:25,935
all the way back to the first breath
his cluster ever took.

121
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,480
He was telling me
what it meant to be sensate.

122
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:31,483
But I-- I don't understand
how they never found me out.

123
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,736
I've had x-rays, MRIs, blood tests...

124
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:37,322
The differences are very subtle.

125
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:42,244
Understand, we are closer to humankind
than the bonobo is to a baboon.

126
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:46,665
You've gotta know what you're looking for.
Evolution is frugal in her variation.

127
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:51,461
One small chromosome here or there
and you walk on two legs instead of four.

128
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:56,007
But I look the same.
I feel the same.

129
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:59,762
- Really?
- In most ways.

130
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,014
You mean when you're not
sharing your most private thoughts

131
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:05,434
with someone
on the other side of the world?

132
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,108
(no audio from TV)

133
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,500
You're Capheus.

134
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,965
I'm Kala.

135
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,218
You are beautiful.

136
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,387
Thank you.

137
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,391
- Do you mind if I...?
- Please, sit.

138
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:56,819
- That is a very large television.
- Ah, yes. (chuckles)

139
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:01,239
Samsung SMT-4023, 42 inches.

140
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:04,493
Best value, color space, and resolution.

141
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:05,869
(chuckles)

142
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:11,374
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

143
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,253
The first time I went
into a house like this in Bombay...

144
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:19,842
they had no beds,
but they had a television as big as this.

145
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:24,680
I mean, how can a TV
be more important than a bed?

146
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:27,307
Ah... That's simple.

147
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,768
The bed keeps you in a slum.

148
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:32,103
The flat screen takes you out.

149
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:34,731
- Ah...
- Eh.

150
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,941
- (Kala chuckles)
- (no audio from TV)

151
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:41,446
- What are you watching?
- Lionheart.

152
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,032
- Never heard of it.
- Really?

153
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:45,200
- (Kala chuckles)
- Ah!

154
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:47,285
Does it have any dancing in it?

155
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:51,289
Jean-Claude is the Fred Astaire...
of martial arts.

156
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:54,209
Ah... I love Fred Astaire.

157
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,671
Lionheart is the first movie that
made me fall in love with Jean-Claude.

158
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,424
I watch it any time
I need to find courage.

159
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,137
I could use some courage right now.

160
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:17,774
(microwave beeps)

161
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:50,014
- (crowd clapping on TV)
- (Kala groans)

162
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,976
- (man) Lionheart!
- (fighter grunting)

163
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:53,977
(Kala groans)

164
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,730
I thought you said
this film had dancing in it.

165
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,314
This is dancing.

166
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:00,483
It's so violent.

167
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,985
Life is violent.

168
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,073
It is.

169
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,034
I didn't think so before.

170
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,037
But you do now.

171
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,547
(Jonas) Watch a flock of birds
or a shoal of fish move as one...

172
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:24,591
and you glimpse where we came from.

173
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:28,887
Ask how aspen trees feel trauma
hundreds of miles apart,

174
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:32,223
or how a mushroom
can understand the needs of a forest...

175
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,560
you'd begin to grasp what we are.

176
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:38,354
Our kind has been here
since the beginning.

177
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,317
In all likelihood, we were the beginning.

178
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:48,197
What I want... is to make sure
we're there at the end.

179
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:51,743
But if there's another species
of Homo sapien, how can it be a secret?

180
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,370
Secrets are important to their species.

181
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:57,582
Secrets are the center
of their identities, of their societies.

182
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,002
Secrets maintain their hierarchies.

183
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:04,589
To reveal this secret,
that there is another kind of human,

184
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:08,718
one whose existence threatens
the very fundament of their reality...

185
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,431
No... they'll never allow that.

186
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,186
Do you have a secret, Jonas?

187
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,107
You're a good cop, aren't you?

188
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,947
They're gonna try to use me to get to you
and the rest of your cluster.

189
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,490
The one who came for Nomi, Dr. Matheson?

190
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,869
He uses many names.

191
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:37,163
- (man whispers) Jonas...
- Angelica called him Whispers.

192
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,042
Never look him in the eye.

193
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,460
Never.

194
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,798
Angelica.

195
00:18:47,674 --> 00:18:49,467
That's why she killed herself.

196
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:51,845
To protect us.

197
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:20,164
My father told me something
that always stayed with me.

198
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,333
It's probably what kept me alive.

199
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:24,419
He said that what made us "us"

200
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:27,422
was far less important
than what makes them "them."

201
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,299
In the end,
it doesn't matter who came first.

202
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:34,054
All that matters is the fact
that one small chromosomal mutation

203
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:37,557
severed them from their connection
to nature, and to each other.

204
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,561
That isolation has allowed them
to focus on the one thing they do better

205
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:44,188
than any species in history.

206
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:50,319
Killing is easy...
when you can feel nothing.

207
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,095
- Search him.
- I just did.

208
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,431
Search him again!

209
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:21,601
He's a fucking smart guy,
aren't you, Wolfie?

210
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:25,521
He knows all the tricks, so fucking smart.

211
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,360
Just found that.

212
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:34,156
Open it. Could be wired.

213
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:38,701
Open it!

214
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,500
(exhales softly)

215
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,710
(softly) Yeah! (laughs)

216
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,132
(whistles)

217
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:59,514
So fucking smart. You think Felix
would think you're so fucking smart now?

218
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,475
You got what you wanted.

219
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:06,688
I wanna know something.
How did you do it?

220
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:10,025
When I walked in, the safe was clean.

221
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,194
I spent two hours cutting it open.

222
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,738
Tell me... how you did it.

223
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,825
I cracked it.

224
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:21,786
You cracked it?

225
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:24,956
Like... in the movies?

226
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,459
Listening to the tumblers
with your stethoscope?

227
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:29,961
You just cracked it?!

228
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,719
Fucking smart guy, right here!

229
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:41,723
First guy in history
to fuck the pants off an S&D safe.

230
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:42,974
Huh?

231
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:44,475
(grunts)

232
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,688
Is that really
what you expect me to believe?

233
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,232
You think I'm that fucking stupid?

234
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,441
- Huh?!
- (grunts)

235
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:59,448
Oh. Is that what you think?

236
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:02,827
You think I'm stupid, huh?

237
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:06,581
Hey, Wolfie, where you going?

238
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:08,666
You haven't answered my question yet.

239
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:12,295
Answer my fucking question.

240
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:18,051
You think I'm stupid?
That what you think? Huh?!

241
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:20,636
(exhales) No.

242
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,848
Well, OK.

243
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:26,059
First smart thing you said.

244
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:30,939
Now... tell me the fucking truth
or I'll blow your smart-guy brains

245
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,190
all over the fucking street!

246
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:22,824
You knew everything.

247
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,954
You knew he would hit you,
you knew you would fall to the ground.

248
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:31,791
But he kicked you and drove you
away from the gun. You were really close.

249
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:36,587
All I needed was a little space.

250
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:41,592
Why don't you just...
tell him something he wants to hear?

251
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:43,427
Tell him... Tell him...

252
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:46,681
I don't know, just a little lie
that will make him relax and then we--

253
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:47,974
we'll figure it out.

254
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,142
I can't.

255
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,311
Why?

256
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:53,980
He reminds me of my father.

257
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:55,940
Just a little lie.

258
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:02,364
OK. May I?

259
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,448
Do you mind?

260
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,331
(Steiner) Did you hear me?!

261
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:15,501
Tell me the fucking truth. (panting)

262
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:16,585
(screams) Tell me!

263
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,462
(Steiner grunts)

264
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:31,267
It was Felix. It was Felix.

265
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:35,688
He found out... the Indian liked boys.

266
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:40,402
Ran into him at a club,
fed him some drinks.

267
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:44,572
- (Steiner giggling)
- Felix got the combination from him.

268
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:48,326
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

269
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,328
Fucking Felix!

270
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:53,956
(chuckles) I bet he sucked his cock!

271
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,125
There had to be
some cock-sucking involved.

272
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,877
He sucked his cock, didn't he?

273
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:00,671
(sighs)

274
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:02,215
He did what he had to do.

275
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:05,676
Ooh! Cock-sucking Felix!

276
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,511
(laughing)

277
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,265
Look! Look at this.

278
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,308
Would any of you suck cock for this?

279
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,643
Sure.

280
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,985
That's why you and cock-sucking Felix
and Wolfie are all fucking idiots,

281
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:25,696
and I'm the only one
with some fucking brains here!

282
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:33,662
What?!

283
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,378
(machine gun fire)

284
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,715
(machine gun fire)

285
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,517
You're fucking dead!

286
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,936
You and your cock-sucking friend
are fucking dead!

287
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,155
What the fuck?!

288
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:12,410
Fuck!

289
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,627
(fire crackling)

290
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,391
Fucking hell!

291
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,310
That's what I'm talking about!

292
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:40,646
Fucking hell, man.

293
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:43,024
What the fuck is that?

294
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,445
Thank you.

295
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,283
Lying is easy.

296
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,826
It's what I do.

297
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:59,999
Sometimes... you make a mistake.

298
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:02,293
You've got two choices:

299
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:04,920
you live with it, or you fix it.

300
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:24,023
(panting)

301
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:27,443
(line ringing)

302
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:30,696
(recording plays) Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

303
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:31,822
(machine beeps)

304
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:34,534
Hernando, you might
never get this message.

305
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,202
Your mailbox is full.

306
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:39,372
You should really-- It doesn't matter.

307
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,835
I made a terrible mistake, my love...

308
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:49,382
but I swear to you...
that I'm gonna fix it.

309
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:18,077
(Will) Hi.

310
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:19,870
Hi.

311
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,460
You all right?

312
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,922
I'm here to see my father.

313
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:32,467
- He's playing tonight?
- Mm-hm.

314
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,135
That's cool. It's gonna be great.

315
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:37,305
I'm actually seeing my dad, too.

316
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:44,145
(whispers) What is it?

317
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:47,607
I saw Jonas.

318
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,068
He said that it was dangerous
for you to be in Iceland.

319
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,905
Yrsa said the same thing.

320
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:56,616
Will you please be careful?

321
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:02,580
Yrsa said something else, too.

322
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:10,045
She said that Jonas can't be trusted...
that he worked with BPO.

323
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,756
(sighs) Mm...

324
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,050
I don't know what's true or not.

325
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,928
I just think we have to...
watch out for each other.

326
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,227
I was just thinking...

327
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,984
I was thinking that...
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

328
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:36,947
There was a time when...

329
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:41,827
that wouldn't have meant anything to me,
but... now it does.

330
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,042
Thank you.

331
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,514
(chuckles)

332
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:30,418
Oh, my God. If this feels that good
when we're not really here,

333
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:32,545
what's it gonna be like when we are?

334
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:55,610
You came back.

335
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:57,861
Yes... I did.

336
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:00,448
Can I get you something?

337
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,367
Double tequila.

338
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:24,138
Another?

339
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,391
You ask me if I want another?

340
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,977
Then I want two.

341
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,437
Two double tequilas.

342
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:33,648
Tequila squared.

343
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:38,193
- Four?
- Four. Yes.

344
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:42,615
(adds two glasses)

345
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:44,032
(unscrews bottle)

346
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,588
Listen, if I offended you before...
I'm sorry.

347
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:01,425
Do not apologize.

348
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,929
- (sets glass down heavily)
- (pants)

349
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:07,473
The mistake was mine.

350
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:16,190
- (sets glass down)
- (sighs)

351
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,984
(softly) I should've told you the truth.

352
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,752
This is a stolen kiss...

353
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:41,423
because these lips belong to another.

354
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:45,678
And even though
you're a very attractive man...

355
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:48,305
and your offer
to do terrible things to me was...

356
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:51,851
was effective...

357
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:55,646
I should've told you, "No, thank you"...

358
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,650
because I have
already met the love of my life...

359
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,279
and his name is Hernando.

360
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,413
(sighs)

361
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:15,541
(exhales sharply)

362
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,335
(doors close)

363
00:33:23,006 --> 00:33:26,176
- Riley! Hey! Hey!
- Riles!

364
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,095
(chuckles)
They told me you were out here.

365
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:29,346
- (man) Hey.
- (Riley) Hey.

366
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,349
Oh, just getting
the creative juices flowing.

367
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,101
That's pretty cute.

368
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,561
Cute?

369
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:38,689
Getting stoned in your tuxes
like it's 1985.

370
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:41,817
- For some of us, it is 1985.
- (Riley laughs)

371
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,236
I don't mean it badly.

372
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,530
It's what we were
talking about today, Papa.

373
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:49,283
It's not much different in London,
but we don't use pot.

374
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,577
Oh, no?
What do you use then?

375
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:55,247
Usually start with one of these.

376
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,165
(Gunnar) Oh, wow. What's that?

377
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:58,333
Ecstasy.

378
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:03,422
Yeah.

379
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,968
All right.

380
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:18,437
Oh, you got the brats!

381
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,106
Yeah, I got the brats.

382
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:26,946
- From Gene's?
- Yeah, Dad, from Gene's.

383
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,406
Come here. Gimme a kiss.

384
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,912
(inaudible dialogue)

385
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,460
(tires squealing)

386
00:35:45,566 --> 00:35:46,942
What do you want, faggot?

387
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,318
I've come for my friend.

388
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,821
Come on, Dani.

389
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:52,781
Are you sure, Lito?

390
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:55,951
You're coming home.

391
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:01,749
Where are you going, Dani? Hm?

392
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:04,001
I'm going with Lito, obviously.

393
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:07,212
This is fucking bullshit.

394
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,215
- She's not going anywhere with you.
- It's over, Joaquin.

395
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,175
(chuckles softly)

396
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:18,140
Listen, you're forgetting
one little thing, faggot.

397
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,934
I still have the pictures.

398
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:24,939
If she gets in that car...
it's bye-bye career.

399
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,484
(sighs)
Do what you want with the pictures.

400
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,405
I don't care.

401
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:37,701
Let's go home.

402
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:39,703
Aah!

403
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,289
I don't want to hurt you, Joaquin.

404
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,083
(Daniela whimpers)

405
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,459
All right.

406
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:48,796
We can do this easy... or we can do this--

407
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:50,798
- (Joaquin yells)
- (gasps)

408
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:53,634
(Lito groans)

409
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,218
(Joaquin screams)

410
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:56,678
(groaning)

411
00:37:01,892 --> 00:37:03,102
(grunting)

412
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:06,772
- (Joaquin shouts)
- Not in the face! No, no!

413
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,983
(Lito) Not in the face! (groans)

414
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:10,233
Not in the face.

415
00:37:10,317 --> 00:37:11,193
Aw!

416
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:14,029
Yes! Yes!

417
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:17,365
You like that? Huh?!

418
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:22,287
- You want more? You want more?
- Come on.

419
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,622
That's all you got? Come on!

420
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,667
- (Joaquin growls)
- (Lito grunts)

421
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:29,544
(groans)

422
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:35,050
Joaquin, Joaquin, no. No, no, no!

423
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,969
- Joaquin! Ahh!
- (Joaquin grunts)

424
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,428
(Lito shrieks)

425
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:42,057
- (yells)
- (pot shatters)

426
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,977
Now you sell flowers, pussy? Huh?

427
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,896
- Come on, come on!
- (grunts)

428
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,023
(groans)

429
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,111
(both grunting)

430
00:37:57,531 --> 00:38:00,492
(Joaquin panting)

431
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:07,415
(voice distant)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

432
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:08,625
(shrieks)

433
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:16,967
Get up.

434
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:35,318
Joaquin!

435
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,947
We're not done.

436
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:42,117
(Daniela whimpers)

437
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:50,417
(laughing)

438
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:56,298
(yells)

439
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:00,010
You call that a punch?

440
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,178
(grunts)

441
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:04,556
Come on, you can do better, huh?
I'm right here.

442
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:09,436
Are we done? Huh? I think we're done.

443
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,437
(grunts)

444
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,189
- Fucker!
- (groans)

445
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:15,734
(body thuds)

446
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:28,914
(panting)

447
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:30,082
Thank you.

448
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,335
Fighting is easy.

449
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:35,921
Fighting is what I do.

450
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,307
Let's go home, Dani.

451
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:57,192
It's a perfect night.
I love the Fourth of July.

452
00:39:57,276 --> 00:40:00,195
It's my... It's my favorite holiday.

453
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:02,697
I mean, I'm here with my kid.

454
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:04,992
Pretty soon, they're gonna blow up shit.

455
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,496
Doesn't get better than this.

456
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:18,713
You know, when I was a kid, I thought...
I thought I couldn't be a cop.

457
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,550
My dad was an electrician.

458
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:26,180
He got out of the war, joined the union.

459
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:30,225
I thought... "When I grow up,
I'm gonna be an electrician."

460
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:35,939
The summer I turned 15, my old man
takes me down to the union hall.

461
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:38,233
He's so proud.

462
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:42,321
I get my card... but I hated the job.

463
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,447
Hated the job.

464
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,578
I kept shocking myself,
and his friends are all laughin' at me.

465
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,459
I quit that summer.

466
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:58,795
He was...

467
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:04,176
He was furious, like,
"What are you gonna do with your life?"

468
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:08,430
I told him, "I'm gonna be a cop."

469
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,517
The way he looked at me...

470
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:15,729
(sighs) I'll never forget it.

471
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:20,775
Like he didn't know who I was.

472
00:41:24,196 --> 00:41:25,906
I'll tell you something, though.

473
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,283
The day you told me
you wanted to be a cop...

474
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:31,412
proudest damn day of my life.

475
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,958
(indistinct chatter)

476
00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:50,180
(laughs)

477
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:53,934
- (pop music playing)
- (fireworks booming)

478
00:41:58,646 --> 00:41:59,564
Whoo!

479
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:02,776
Cheers!

480
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:11,618
(moaning)

481
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,631
Yeah!

482
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:48,530
- (fireworks crackling)
- (Will and his father cheer)

483
00:43:03,337 --> 00:43:04,463
(groans)

484
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:07,882
Aah!

485
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,514
Oh, God!

486
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,064
(panting) Oh, my...

487
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:27,819
Now that... is what I call fireworks.

488
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,280
(both laugh)

489
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,741
(fireworks crackling)

490
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,160
Whoo!

491
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:39,080
I love fireworks.

492
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,957
Me, too.

493
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,502
Me, three. (laughs)

494
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:46,129
(Capheus) Whoo!

495
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:51,426
- Whoo!
- (fireworks crackling rapidly)

496
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:02,937
(doorbell rings)

497
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,155
What happened to you?

498
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:16,535
- I got in a fight.
- What?

499
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:18,161
A fight?

500
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:21,331
Are you stupid? Look at your face.
You won't be able to shoot tomorrow.

501
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,168
You do still love me.

502
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,342
(grunts softly) Well, I know
how important your career is to you.

503
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:40,141
Can I come in?

504
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:43,895
Please?

505
00:44:53,363 --> 00:44:55,156
(Hernando sighs)

506
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:00,870
You were right, Hernando.

507
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:04,124
I was a coward.

508
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,256
I cared too much about things that...
aren't important.

509
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:16,719
I took for granted all the things
you gave up in life to... be with me.

510
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:21,475
Many of these things became clear
because of Daniela.

511
00:45:21,558 --> 00:45:24,018
I understand why
you reacted the way you did.

512
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,068
I made a terrible mistake.

513
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:39,033
But I fixed it.

514
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:41,620
(approaching footsteps)

515
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,250
- Dani?
- (laughs)

516
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:53,214
- (Daniela) Ay...
- (Hernando sighs)

517
00:45:55,758 --> 00:45:57,302
I-- I don't understand.

518
00:45:57,385 --> 00:45:59,095
Lito saved me! He saved me.

519
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,222
Joaquin tried to stop me from going,
but Lito fought him.

520
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:02,890
It was-- It was unbelievable.

521
00:46:02,974 --> 00:46:05,644
It was like a scene
from one of his movies!

522
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:11,816
And... what about the pictures?

523
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,362
I don't care.

524
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:20,617
My career is important to me.

525
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:24,829
But it will never be as important as you.

526
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,714
I love you.

527
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:44,599
(camera clicks)

528
00:46:46,643 --> 00:46:47,769
(clicks)

529
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,730
Really?

530
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,649
