Do you know that feeling
when you're sitting in a movie theater

3
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:17,618
and everyone's laughing at something

4
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,829
- and you just don't get it?
- Yeah.

5
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,498
Like all the time.

6
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,583
This is where I'm at right now.

7
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:29,797
I'm sitting looking at the sunrise,
the city,

8
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,760
and I'm wondering, how can something
still look so beautiful

9
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:37,221
after we saw what we saw?

10
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,684
It just doesn't seem right.

11
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,602
No, it doesn't.

12
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,231
Are you all right, dear?

13
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:31,234
- I need to use the ladies' room.
- Go on.

14
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:36,321
Aah!

15
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:00,971
My God.

16
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,599
What happened to him?

17
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,692
It was... my fault.

18
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,406
I wanted to prove something.

19
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,868
I wanted to change something
that can't be changed.

20
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,287
What?

21
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,125
The past.

22
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,719
- Hello?
- It's me.

23
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:42,305
Dani?

24
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,350
Daniela?

25
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:49,937
- Where are you?
- I did it.

26
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,940
I got my phone back.
Everything's fine. I fixed it.

27
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:54,524
How do you know?

28
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,735
How do you know
everything's going to be fixed?

29
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,906
It just is, all right?

30
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,700
- Why are you whispering?
- Is she coming back?

31
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,995
I just wanted you to know
you don't have to worry.

32
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,914
- Are you coming back?
- I better go.

33
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,589
What did she say?

34
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,009
She said everything's going to be fine.

35
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,677
She fixed it.

36
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:23,804
She got the phone back.

37
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,308
Is she still with him?

38
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,019
- Huh?
- I don't know.

39
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,731
But this is good news, isn't it?

40
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,959
Hey. Hey, hey!

41
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,098
Is Jela home?

42
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:09,433
Fuck you!

43
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:11,476
You are looking very well, Elena.

44
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,104
Shithead, it's Motherfucker.

45
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:17,733
How do I tell them apart if you
keep calling all my friends motherfuckers?

46
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,277
Oh, it's this motherfucker.

47
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,778
Here.

48
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:36,377
It's the nicest thing a motherfucker's
done for me today.

49
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,467
To the ancestors.

50
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:51,267
You and Elena are not getting along?

51
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,642
You have money. What's wrong?

52
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:56,397
It's me. She hates me being home.

53
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,359
I can't blame her.

54
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,111
I'm a stallion, Capheus.

55
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,654
I go a little crazy locked up in a barn.

56
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,409
Maybe it's time to go back to work.

57
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,203
Are you serious?

58
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,958
I realized today I cannot
keep doing what I'm doing.

59
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,794
I've not yet told Mr. Kabaka this.

60
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:22,298
I'm not sure I know how
to tell Mr. Kabaka this.

61
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,425
But I cannot go back there again.

62
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:28,971
The matatu is our work, eh?

63
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:32,141
Real work. Clean work.

64
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:35,811
You saved my life once again,
my friend!

65
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,563
Light of my life,
I'm going back to work!

66
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,608
- Is that true?
- Ah.

67
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,237
Thank you, Van Damme!

68
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:48,949
Let's go inside.

69
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,575
- Yeah, sure.
- Come, come, come!

70
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:54,913
Ah... Oh, shit.

71
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:02,796
You'll never have outside privilege
if you continue teaching me.

72
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,465
I rarely get to go out.

73
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,967
But today looks beautiful.

74
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,052
It does.

75
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,930
They let us paint outside.

76
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:14,475
You like to paint?

77
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,393
I don't mind staying in.

78
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,312
Helping you makes time go quickly.

79
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,607
Soo-Jin!

80
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,738
Why does she choose you?

81
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,283
I'm fast.

82
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,077
I tried working more slowly once.

83
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,704
That...

84
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,914
That did not work out very well.

85
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,752
Bitch!

86
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,755
What are you doing?

87
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,257
That's not done.

88
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,259
Pick that up!

89
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,182
Get back to your seat!

90
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:10,239
My mother did not teach me to sew,
but my father taught me business.

91
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:13,367
This is called "second mover advantage."

92
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,287
The second mouse enjoys the cheese.

93
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,458
Today, you go outside. She sews.

94
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,586
Thank you.

95
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,172
You've known him a long time.

96
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,927
How did you meet?

97
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,181
Detention.

98
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:49,027
Welcome to my office, newbie.
Have a seat.

99
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,872
I'm Felix.

100
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,959
Wolfgang.

101
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,003
Wolfgang?

102
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,299
Nobody's named Wolfgang.

103
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,972
OK... Wolfie.

104
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,683
- What are you in for?
- Fighting.

105
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,810
Cool.

106
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:25,439
Where are you?

107
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:27,524
At the movies.

108
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,819
With my family.

109
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,613
Makes sense.

110
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,030
Why?

111
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:38,535
Felix loved the movies.

112
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:41,371
We cut school to watch films all the time.

113
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,543
No one will remember
if we were good men or bad.

114
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:49,796
All that matters is that
two stood against many.

115
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,382
This film's a masterpiece.

116
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,843
So grant me one request.

117
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,762
Grant me revenge!

118
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:02,685
And if you do not listen...
then to hell with you!

119
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:16,490
You finished!

120
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,619
I did.

121
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,329
Thank you for teaching me.

122
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:24,164
No, thank you.

123
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:27,917
This is our mural of happier times.

124
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,919
I'm painting my three sisters.

125
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:33,131
I miss them.

126
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:37,093
Do you miss your family?

127
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,346
No.

128
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,599
I miss my dog.

129
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,648
You're welcome to paint your dog.

130
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,651
Or anything else.

131
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:59,575
Sometimes... it feels good to remember.

132
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:05,080
I don't know why he liked me.

133
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:09,000
In those days, when we moved
from East to West Berlin,

134
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:11,211
I was the kid everyone hated.

135
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:16,174
Hey, you! Commie!

136
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:18,761
Your shitty country is ruining ours.

137
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,512
Get the hell out!

138
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:21,846
You don't belong here!

139
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:24,474
You better go.

140
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,059
- No!
- Go!

141
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:34,610
My dad says you're
costing us billions in taxes.

142
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,487
You're going to start
paying us back... now.

143
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,072
Come and get it!

144
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Aah!

145
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:58,383
"No one will remember
if we are good men or bad!"

146
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:00,927
You're dead!

147
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,935
"Only that two stood against many."

148
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,273
That was your childhood?

149
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,024
No.

150
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:19,112
That was nothing... compared to my father.

151
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,325
Life is simple, boys.

152
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:35,211
Life is just five things:
eating, drinking, shitting, fucking...

153
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,757
and fighting for more.

154
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:49,142
I didn't say anything about crying.

155
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,103
Crying is for bitches.

156
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,192
That what you are?

157
00:13:58,652 --> 00:13:59,862
A little bitch?

158
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,622
"Conan, what is best in life?"

159
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,166
He's crazy.

160
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:20,465
"To crush your enemies,
to see them driven before you!"

161
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,847
He would do anything for you.

162
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:30,350
He's my brother.

163
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:38,274
And not by something
as accidental as blood...

164
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,403
by something much stronger.

165
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:44,656
What?

166
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,828
By choice.

167
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:02,173
Is that your mother and you?

168
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:05,176
She took me to the Spring Festival.

169
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,429
We had ice cream.

170
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:12,475
Oh, I'm sorry.

171
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,644
It was an accident.

172
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,649
I know people like you.

173
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:24,028
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

174
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:28,157
Not better or worse, just different.

175
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,035
You got a smart mouth.

176
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:37,793
Only if one assumes that a master's
in economics constitutes a smart mouth,

177
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,503
as opposed to educated.

178
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,381
Many educated people are quite stupid,

179
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:48,011
and many stupid people
like to start fights for no good reason

180
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,639
on a truly beautiful day.

181
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,100
Let us not ruin it.

182
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:59,606
Only thing I want to ruin
is that smart mouth.

183
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,743
Stop fighting.
I don't want to hurt you.

184
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:23,713
Aah!

185
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,772
Aah!

186
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:43,399
Hey, hey, hey!

187
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,189
Oh.

188
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,570
I was worried about you.

189
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,279
I'm OK.

190
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:34,200
You still in London?

191
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,329
I'm home.

192
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,341
This is where I grew up.

193
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,054
Let me show you.

194
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,145
This is the piano where
my dad practices every morning.

195
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,417
When I was little, I used to lay
on this rug with my coloring book,

196
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,441
listening to him.

197
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:10,987
When I think of the word "happy,"

198
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:13,489
that rug is the first thing
that comes into my head.

199
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:15,867
Your dad's kind of a big deal, huh?

200
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:18,536
Mm-hm.

201
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,540
Especially in Iceland.

202
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,920
Icelanders really like it if you get
famous somewhere else and then come back.

203
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,546
They respect you more that way.

204
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:32,717
Oh, is that your mom?

205
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:37,513
She's beautiful.

206
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,224
She was.

207
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,728
Oh, she passed away.

208
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,271
Mm-hm.

209
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:49,109
- Sorry.
- Are you talking to me, honey?

210
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,527
No, I was just talking to myself.

211
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:54,238
Here you go.

212
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,240
- Still black with one sugar?
- Thanks, Dad.

213
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,785
That's how I take my coffee, too.

214
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:01,121
- I've gotta go.
- OK.

215
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,497
You're home.

216
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,125
Oh, I can't believe it.

217
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,085
- See you tonight.
- See you later.

218
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,463
He seems like a nice man.

219
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,090
He is.

220
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:16,052
Why did you stay away so long?

221
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:20,723
Oh, you don't have to explain it.

222
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,143
I ask way too many questions.
Bad cop habit.

223
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:28,148
A lot of things that are
hard to talk about happened here.

224
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,954
We know what you did for Soo-Jin.

225
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,175
So, this is your home?

226
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,551
Yeah.

227
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:42,388
Yeah, it's kinda small, you know?

228
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:44,348
Cops don't get paid a lot.

229
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:45,808
I like it.

230
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:49,938
This is so cool.

231
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,399
Wow.

232
00:20:55,902 --> 00:20:57,904
You should come to America sometime.

233
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,115
Chicago's got a great music scene.

234
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:05,287
Uh, jazz, blues, house... I could show you
around the city before you even got here.

235
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,747
I could show you around Reykjavik.

236
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,793
So cool.

237
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:14,296
I want to see the volcano
no one can pronounce the name of.

238
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:15,838
Eyjafjallajokull?

239
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:17,966
God bless you.

240
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:22,929
Oh, my God, what is that?

241
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,309
You sleep here?

242
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,477
You get used to it.

243
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,896
Oh, my God!

244
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,609
Wow!

245
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:01,903
The fuck you doing, Gorski?

246
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,075
Huh?

247
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:10,661
Everything is so much better now.

248
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:14,207
- Yes, so much better.
- Uh, we spoke to the astrologer,

249
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,419
and he says that the horoscope
for the new wedding date

250
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,254
is even better than the last one.

251
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,339
- The last one was not bad.
- No, no, not bad.

252
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:23,674
- But this is better.
- So much better.

253
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:27,053
Clearly, the gods wanted it this way.

254
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:31,099
So, uh, you wish
to use the temple of Ganesha?

255
00:23:31,182 --> 00:23:32,892
Yes.

256
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:37,021
Since I was a child, I have always
felt a closeness to Ganesha,

257
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:40,900
that he sees through my eyes
and I see through his.

258
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:10,763
I can't remember the last time I smelled
your sukuma wiki and ugali.

259
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:13,724
Ah.
I'm feeling much better.

260
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:16,769
But you are far too thin.

261
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:31,284
It makes my heart sing
to see you cooking again.

262
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:35,371
You were never good
at hiding your emotions.

263
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:42,420
What is troubling you, my son?

264
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:49,135
This medicine...
the man I was getting it from...

265
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:54,140
I won't be able to get it
from him anymore.

266
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:04,317
Troubles like this seem far less troubling
on a full stomach.

267
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:11,824
Family is so important.

268
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:15,036
- What do you want?
- I had a family once.

269
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,539
- Get out!
- Capheus!

270
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,290
I had a sister.

271
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,085
We were tight, like you and moms here.

272
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:27,590
One day, me and Mr. Kabaka
had a disagreement.

273
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,469
I came home and she's lying there,

274
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:35,473
a wire around her throat,
her scalp torn off.

275
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:42,522
That's what Mr. Silas Kabaka taught me.

276
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:48,694
- Love ain't nothing but a black hole.
- No, no!

277
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,201
What do you want?

278
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,161
Come on, hero.

279
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,914
What does every person on this planet want

280
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:03,084
whose life has been fucked up
by another person?

281
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,711
What the fuck do you think we want?!

282
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,590
What does he want?

283
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:10,007
And why here?

284
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,800
Why did he want to meet here?

285
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:15,137
She said it was halfway.
She wanted to make it easy.

286
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:18,807
Oh, come on, Hernando. This is Joaquin.
He wanted us to meet in public.

287
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:21,810
- Maybe you should wait in the car.
- I think I should wait in the car.

288
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,521
Yes. Yes.

289
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:43,124
Hi.

290
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:45,543
Dani...

291
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,129
Thanks.

292
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:50,673
Sorry it's so late.

293
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,342
It's the only time he could do it.

294
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,470
It's not a problem.

295
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,602
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm good.

296
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:12,027
He hit you.

297
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,072
We were... negotiating.

298
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:18,618
No, no. This is wrong.
You cannot go back to that asshole...

299
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:21,663
I told that asshole I would marry him
if he left you alone.

300
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:23,581
What?

301
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:26,375
Lito!

302
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:34,758
Hernando, no. No, no, no,
don't worry about me.

303
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:37,011
What? This is crazy. Come on!

304
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,471
What?

305
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:44,310
We make choices... and life
has a way of making us pay for them.

306
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:47,896
That's a line from
The Price of Life is Death.

307
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:51,108
And you were so great in it.

308
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:55,571
The world is inspired
by your movies, Lito,

309
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,115
and I want you to
continue making them, OK?

310
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:03,579
Dani...

311
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:06,374
Hernando, I'll be fine.

312
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:12,296
If life has taught me anything,
it's that... I can take a punch.

313
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:18,427
Goodbye.

314
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,263
Don't have too much fun without me.

315
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,636
- What am I going to do? I don't know.
- Yes, you do!

316
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:05,266
You cannot give them the child.
You know that!

317
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,226
If I don't, they will come back.

318
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:08,352
You've heard them.

319
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:13,148
That's what men do, they make threats.

320
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:16,944
And you, more than anyone, know they have
the ability to carry those threats out.

321
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:21,156
And you, more than anyone...
you know that their threats

322
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,662
and even their violence...
cannot touch the things that matter.

323
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:41,009
Mama... is it completely
crazy to realize...

324
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,972
even after gangsters
have threatened your life...

325
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,142
how lucky you are?

326
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,481
Not at all.

327
00:29:58,653 --> 00:30:00,696
Not at all.

328
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:14,752
- Baby O'Riley!
- Ah! Sven!

329
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:15,837
It's been so long.

330
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,089
- Riley, it's good to see you.
- You, too.

331
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,179
How's the boat?

332
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:30,768
Uh, it creaks, it groans.
Not as fast as it used to be.

333
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,980
We have that in common.

334
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,484
Skoal.

335
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,947
It's so good to see you, Riley.

336
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:47,576
For weeks, all your father's talked about
is you coming home.

337
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,829
We're all happy to have you back.

338
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:52,164
It's so nice to be back.

339
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,918
This is your home, after all.

340
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:58,838
Born right there.

341
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,258
Ellen and I still laugh about that night.

342
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,595
Gunnar won't let me buy a new phone.

343
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,432
- He calls it the umbilicus.
- Does it even work anymore?

344
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:12,976
I have a cousin in the highlands.

345
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,479
We have the last two rotaries in Iceland.

346
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,776
- Is your dad coming over?
- No, he's practicing.

347
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,239
- Big day tomorrow.
- Mm.

348
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:31,620
Sven, you know I don't drive anymore.

349
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:37,459
Whenever, wherever,
just knock on my door.

350
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:40,838
Thank you.

351
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:53,183
Don't ask me how I know this,
but that woman right there is Nomi Marks.

352
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:56,019
She was scheduled for a brain operation,
she disappeared.

353
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:59,565
This is the federal BOLO for her.

354
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:03,402
And the guy she's talking to
is Niles Bolger.

355
00:32:03,485 --> 00:32:05,446
He had the same brain operation
two years ago.

356
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:09,992
He's now living as a complete vegetable
at Nightingale's, until last night.

357
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,286
Do I even want to know
how you're accessing this shit?

358
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,414
I used my dad's old captain's clearance
for the requisition.

359
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:17,165
Oh, my God.

360
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,377
Yesterday, Bolger receives a package.

361
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:22,379
The FedEx guy doesn't
know what to do with it.

362
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:25,215
I know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna bury us with this.

363
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:26,467
Watch this.

364
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:31,597
Whoa.

365
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,476
Last night, a guy who couldn't drink
from a coffee cup without drooling

366
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,811
went on a shooting spree.

367
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:39,229
One of the people he killed
before eating his own gun

368
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:41,482
is the doctor who performed
the surgery on him,

369
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:44,443
and was scheduled to do
the exact same thing to Nomi Marks.

370
00:32:44,526 --> 00:32:48,363
OK, if this was an episode of CSI,
I'm hooked,

371
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,527
but cut to the goddamn chase and tell me
what the fuck this has to do with us.

372
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:54,495
The company that paid Dr. Metzger
to perform those surgeries,

373
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:56,580
that paid for the long-term care
of Niles Bolger,

374
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:59,291
is the exact same company
that rented the white van

375
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:02,294
that made one of the most dangerous
terrorists in America disappear.

376
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:04,755
And this company is called?

377
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,300
BPO, the Biologic
Preservation Organization.

378
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:12,262
"A multi-national research group
studying the human genome

379
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:15,975
in the search for positive
and consequential mutations."

380
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:18,226
Well, that doesn't sound
sinister at all.

381
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,590
These guys are seriously funded.

382
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:23,565
I'm finding embeds to DARPA,
the World Science Foundation, the WHO...

383
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:26,276
How are you able to access
their financial records?

384
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,740
You're the guy that helped me
get out of the hospital.

385
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:34,952
- That's right.
- What guy?

386
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,455
He's standing right there
and he's a cop.

387
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,749
Chicago PD.
A lot of that stuff is illegal.

388
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,710
So is using your father's
clearance codes

389
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:44,837
to access federal security information.

390
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,380
How did you know about that?

391
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:47,631
Know what?

392
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:50,551
I'm not sure.

393
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:53,971
OK, you've having a conversation
with a cop in Chicago right now?

394
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:55,723
Yeah, I guess I am.

395
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:58,225
Cool.

396
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:00,561
FaceTime without a phone.

397
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,980
I mean, not exactly.
We can know things and feel things.

398
00:34:04,314 --> 00:34:05,774
She can't hear you.

399
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:07,902
Who the fuck you talkin' to, man?

400
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:10,195
Noth... I'm just talking to myself.

401
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:13,323
You were at the shooting last night?

402
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:14,616
You've killed us all.

403
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:20,492
The only reason they would do something
like that is if they felt threatened.

404
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:21,790
That means we're getting close.

405
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:26,754
It also means that if they have
no problem killing their own people,

406
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:28,923
then they'll have no problem killing us.

407
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,887
Did you find anything
on Metzger's hard drive?

408
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,765
So you know about the hard drive,
but you don't know what's on it?

409
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,684
No one gave me a rule book here.
I'm just trying to go with it.

410
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:45,439
Uh... Basically, they've been
paying this guy a butt-load of money

411
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,566
to fly all over the world
and lobotomize people.

412
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,027
I think he hooked up
with the company when...

413
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:54,740
When he was a medical student
at the University of Chicago.

414
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,367
- Mom!
- That picture.

415
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:59,202
- Wait.
- Coming.

416
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:01,538
- I know that guy.
- How?

417
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:03,874
When Bolger put the gun in his mouth,

418
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:08,879
I saw a reflection in the mirror
that wasn't his.

419
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,256
It was that guy.

420
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,927
I'm Dr. Friedmann.

421
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:20,724
Senior Officer with the Biologic
Preservation Organization.

422
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:23,185
That voice...

423
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,269
I know that voice.

424
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:27,230
I thought Nomi
was still in the hospital.

425
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:29,150
I know you think
you're doing the right thing,

426
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:33,779
trying to protect someone you care about,
but this woman has a terrible disease...

427
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,363
- It's him!
- Who?

428
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:36,991
It's that guy.

429
00:35:37,074 --> 00:35:39,118
He says that the guy
at the door is that guy!

430
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,912
So, for your safety, we are putting you
into protective custody.

431
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:44,372
- What?
- Don't look at him.

432
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,001
- Why?
- Jonas told me that's how he hunts.

433
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:49,252
I have a warrant to search these premises,

434
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:52,131
and if you interfere,
you will be arrested and prosecuted

435
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:54,466
- to the full extent of the law.
- You've gotta go right now.

436
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,094
- You can't do this.
- Oh, yes, we can.

437
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,805
No! What are you doing? No!

438
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:02,766
What are you... No, wait!
You can't do this!

439
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:06,228
Amanita! Amanita!

440
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:08,814
OK, out the window,
over the balcony.

441
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,577
- The alley will take you to Corbett.
- No.

442
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:12,529
- You have to come with me.
- No. You need time.

443
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,111
I'll stall them. Go!

444
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,113
Go, honey! Go!

445
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:23,578
Oh, my God.

446
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,792
Fuck.

447
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,127
Oh, my God. Neets.

448
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:33,964
Um... Um... OK.

449
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:35,799
Shit.

450
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:38,219
- Is that you, Mom?
- I'm a federal agent. Open the door.

451
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,595
A federal agent?

452
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,183
- Open the door, ma'am, now!
- Uh... I'm, uh...

453
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,185
kinda in the middle of something.

454
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:50,522
What the fuck?

455
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:53,067
I am changing my tampon,
you fucking pervert!

456
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,237
- Please come with me.
- Can I finish, or do you want this, too?

457
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:57,779
Huh? Huh?

458
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:00,448
You want it? You want it? Fucking take it!

459
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:07,248
- Get eyes on the back alley.
- Copy that.

460
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,638
- Stop! Don't move!
- Oh, God.

461
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:25,015
Hands in the air!

462
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:31,105
Oh, my God.
I don't want to go back to the hospital.

463
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:32,480
Cop guy, where are you?

464
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:36,544
- What are you looking for?
- It's the feds. They found her.

465
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:39,988
- How do you know?
- Gorski, the captain's office, now!

466
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:41,823
We've got her. Back of the hill.

467
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:43,325
Someone, please help me.

468
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:47,662
Stay calm.

469
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,497
Are you in my head or are you here?

470
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:51,041
I'm in Seoul. I was sleeping.

471
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,252
Ah, shit!

472
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:54,544
- Get on your knees!
- Oh...

473
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,213
- Who are you?
- I'm Sun.

474
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,631
We don't have time for this.

475
00:37:57,714 --> 00:37:58,799
He's gonna call for backup.

476
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:00,050
Backup on Corbett.

477
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:02,803
This guy's right-handed.
He's gonna go for your right wrist.

478
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:05,306
Now!

479
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,731
Throw the gun.

480
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,067
Get on the bike.

481
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:30,747
Is there a problem, Captain?

482
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:32,791
Shut the door.

483
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:58,942
Stop her!

484
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,792
I don't know how to drive.

485
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:18,795
I do.

486
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:37,522
- Are you crazy? Oh!
- I saw this in Hard Target.

487
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,817
Jean-Claude attacked
when everyone thought he was going to run.

488
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,457
Whoo!

489
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,125
It worked better in the movie.

490
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,590
Look, Gorski, this isn't a movie
or a fucking TV show.

491
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:06,885
I gave you clear warning
that if you didn't follow orders,

492
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,554
- there would be consequences.
- OK, but, can I explain?

493
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:13,183
I can explain,
same way they explained it to me.

494
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,976
You're suspended without pay.

495
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,478
Captain.

496
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,063
Captain, you know that is not fair.

497
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,942
What the fuck you talkin' about, Gorski?

498
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:24,194
Not fair?

499
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:26,238
This is the real fuckin' world.

500
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,449
Nothin's fair.

501
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:32,411
Drop your badge, sign the paperwork,
get the fuck out.

502
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,554
It's El Caído.

503
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,651
You said he would come for you.

504
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:10,365
A man must never be judged
by the length of his gun,

505
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,284
or the size of his fortune.

506
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:20,708
In the end, we'll all be judged
by the courage of our hearts.

507
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:32,346
And cut!

508
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:35,015
Give me one more, please. The line!

509
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:37,184
Lito, you're beautiful.

510
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,019
- You sure?
- It's great, we're fine.

511
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,021
We have it, OK?

512
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,565
And your, uh... friend is here.

513
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:50,322
Oh, yeah. My bodyguard. Yeah.

514
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,791
- Hello, Kala.
- Papa-ji.

515
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,836
- I had no idea you came to the temple.
- I don't.

516
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,255
No, I came here to see you.

517
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:11,051
- Can I have a word with you?
- Yes, of course.

518
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:15,013
I was considering our conversation
about continuing the wedding as planned.

519
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:18,559
It's just that, uh,
the events of the past few days

520
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:21,978
have led me to... reconsider things.

521
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,399
- Reconsider?
- Yes.

522
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,860
You know, I don't believe in
gods and miracles.

523
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:32,030
Our fates are governed
by the choices that we make.

524
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:37,994
Others, of course, will argue that luck,
good or bad, is a factor, but I disagree.

525
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:40,497
Luck can only offer an opportunity.

526
00:42:41,373 --> 00:42:44,084
But without the will
to make the right choice,

527
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:49,423
luck would be as meaningless as...
as that elephant-headed god.

528
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:54,886
To me, the idea of praying to a god
to somehow influence my own fate

529
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:58,973
is both primitive and terribly sad.

530
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:03,645
I'm sorry, I don't think this is the place
to have this conversation.

531
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:09,067
Something's wrong?

532
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:19,327
What is it? Is it Joaquin, right?

533
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:21,079
- He's gonna blackmail me.
- No.

534
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:22,747
No, no, I haven't heard from him.

535
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:24,749
Is it Daniela?

536
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:26,376
In a way.

537
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:32,090
I guess, in a way, she reminded me of
the things I had allowed myself to forget

538
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:34,217
because I feel so strongly about you.

539
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,972
Hernando, your tone is scaring me.
What are you talking about?

540
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:43,143
I love you, Lito.

541
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:46,729
I love you more than I have ever
loved anyone in my life.

542
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:48,649
I love you, too.

543
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:52,110
But I can't be with someone
who allows someone else to be hurt

544
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:54,446
in order to protect their career.

545
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:58,741
- I wish it didn't end this way.
- It doesn't end this way.

546
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:00,868
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

547
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:04,414
Hernando, she did this to herself.
She admitted it.

548
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:07,000
You cannot leave me for that.
This is not fair.

549
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,836
- I know it's not fair.
- So what do you want me to do?

550
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:12,797
You want me to throw
my whole life down the toilet

551
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,259
- because of a woman I barely know?
- I don't know what you should do, Lito.

552
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:19,471
All I know is what I have to do.

553
00:44:22,484 --> 00:44:24,285
Are you gonna break up with me
because of her?

554
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:27,270
- No, it's not her.
- Then what?

555
00:44:29,564 --> 00:44:30,898
"In the end...

556
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:36,237
we will all be judged
by the courage of our hearts."

557
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:39,616
It's a stupid line from a stupid movie.
Hernando, please.

558
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:43,786
I'm sorry, Lito.

559
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:49,417
- Goodbye.
- No, please, no. Please don't leave me.

560
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,044
Hernando.

561
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:52,920
Hernando.

562
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:55,465
Hernando!

563
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,264
Hernando, please don't leave me, please.

564
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:11,356
Here we go. Let's shoot!

565
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:18,905
I was hoping that after
our conversation is over,

566
00:45:18,988 --> 00:45:20,782
when you pray to your Ganesha,

567
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:25,912
he'll also tell you that what you are
going to do is the right thing to do.

568
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:27,581
- What I am going to do?
- Mm.

569
00:45:27,664 --> 00:45:29,249
You are going to call up my son

570
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:31,793
and you are going to tell him
that you cannot marry him.

571
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:32,960
What?

572
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,338
You know in your heart
that's the right thing to do.

573
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:36,673
I could see it in your eyes.

574
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:38,466
That's why you stopped the wedding,

575
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,762
to keep yourself from
committing this terrible mistake.

576
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:45,640
- That's not true. That is not why I...
- Of course... Of course it is true.

577
00:45:45,724 --> 00:45:48,226
- I...
- It was a mistake for both our parts.

578
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,604
I should have never given my blessing.

579
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:53,856
But now, luck has given us
another opportunity to correct it.

580
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,817
All we require is the will...

581
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:09,372
No!

582
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:13,585
Help!

583
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:18,214
Help!

584
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:21,050
Papa-ji!

585
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:23,344
Papa-ji!

586
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:24,429
Papa-ji?

587
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:27,557
Help! Help!

588
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:32,687
Somebody! Help!
