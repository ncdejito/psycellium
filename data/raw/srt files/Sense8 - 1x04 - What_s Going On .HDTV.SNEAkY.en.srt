00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:10,812
I mean, everyone wants to believe
they'd be the hero,

3
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:14,440
that they'd join the Resistance,
try to kill Hitler.

4
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,734
It's such fucking bullshit.

5
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,987
It's obedience, not resistance.

6
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,660
That's the glue of every country,
every army, every religion in the world.

7
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:27,662
The fuck are you talking about, Felix?

8
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:30,956
What do you think?
I'm talking about us.

9
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,335
- I'm talking about our revolution.
- We snatched some rocks.

10
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:40,216
Mark my words, Wolfie,
this score is going to change our lives.

11
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,302
Not gonna change shit
if we can't sell them.

12
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,346
He's going to buy.

13
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:48,391
Just relax. Let me do the talking.

14
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,816
- Thank you for waiting.
- Not a problem.

15
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,403
It's nice here, but you know
there's a bigger one in Mettre?

16
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,447
That one smells like piss.

17
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,534
The drunks from the park
use it as a toilet.

18
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:07,744
I like this one better.

19
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:12,206
Whenever I have a difficult
decision to make, I come here.

20
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:16,126
This place brings a clarity
to any decision.

21
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,714
- What were you thinking about?
- My mother.

22
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:23,259
- Did she die in the Holocaust?
- No, she lived.

23
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:26,512
She fell in love with an Englishman
and ran away with him

24
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:28,848
against her parents' wishes.

25
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,103
I think how much courage she had
to make that decision.

26
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:38,942
After the war, she came back
to find her parents, but she never did.

27
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,570
- And she never left Berlin again.
- Mm.

28
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:47,742
Our existence depends
on sheer implausibility,

29
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:52,830
which I'm sure is exactly
how your merchandise

30
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,875
found its way into your pocket.

31
00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:59,336
Does that mean you're interested?

32
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,340
I would like to see them.

33
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:08,930
Please, not here.

34
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:12,266
Any talk of money
seems unimportant here.

35
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,523
<i>We never discuss money.</i>

36
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,358
We have no interest in money.

37
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:24,946
All we are interested in
is making sure that you and your son...

38
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,906
- And your daughter.
- ...are happy.

39
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,074
OK, then we are all in accordance with--

40
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,327
Not exactly. Ah.

41
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:36,332
We have spoken to the priest, uh,

42
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,335
- concerning the, uh--
- Adjustment to the service.

43
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:42,087
Uh, this is my fault.

44
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:44,214
I wanted to add an exchange of rings.

45
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:48,302
Ah, this is a Hindu wedding ceremony.
There are no rings.

46
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,387
- I know.
- There are traditions.

47
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:54,224
Yes, but we are trying to start them
on a path to the 21st century,

48
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:56,310
- not the 16th.
- Of course.

49
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:58,187
And the priest is ready to accommodate.

50
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,149
It's just that with both services,
it appears the ceremony--

51
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:05,486
- Will be over six hours.
- Six hours?

52
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,656
There are certain shortcuts
that others have preferred.

53
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,782
How short?

54
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,036
It depends entirely on how much
you value the priest conducting it.

55
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,286
How much?

56
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,706
The more you give him,
the shorter the ceremony.

57
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,624
The sooner everyone can get to dancing.

58
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,962
Six hours is the starting point.
Pay him double, out in three.

59
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,506
And how much to not perform it at all?

60
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:30,845
You couldn't afford it.

61
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,852
This is important to me.

62
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,229
Married men in India don't wear rings.

63
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,398
There is nothing to show their commitment.

64
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,275
That is why I want one.

65
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:52,491
I want to remember this night
for the rest of my life,

66
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:54,869
and I don't want it to be a secret.

67
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,164
I want the whole world to know
I'm bound to this woman.

68
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,004
Now and forever.

69
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,377
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

70
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:50,424
So smart and so strong.

71
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:55,138
Is that why my father hates me?

72
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,182
He doesn't hate you, my child.

73
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,101
You must never think that.

74
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:04,897
- He loves you.
- He never came to any of my matches.

75
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,859
He went to all of Joong-Ki's matches.

76
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:12,113
You cannot be jealous of your brother.

77
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:17,660
Do not blame him
for how much Father loves him.

78
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:21,371
It is natural for fathers
to be close to their sons.

79
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:25,042
He's planning on Joong-Ki
taking over the company.

80
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:32,175
If I cannot be there
to help Father realize his dream...

81
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,594
you must be there for me.

82
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:41,100
Please, Sun, take care of your brother.

83
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:49,900
Do this for me.

84
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,207
We, like these books,
or these diamonds,

85
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,335
have the secrets of our past
hidden inside us.

86
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:12,006
You think a lot about the past, don't you?

87
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:15,968
Without the past,
there would be nothing to think about,

88
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,595
let alone someone to think it.

89
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,473
Deep.

90
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:25,186
You certainly weren't lying.
These are beauties.

91
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,564
Shall I be honest?

92
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,441
I know I was probably
the last on your list.

93
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:36,739
I'm an outsider to you, but I think I know
where these rocks came from.

94
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:42,286
Out of Mumbai, I'm guessing, and I know
who's going to come looking for them.

95
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:47,124
They will not be easy to move,
unless I recut them.

96
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,545
Recut, they will have
a fraction of their worth.

97
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,091
Let's go, Felix.
I knew this was a waste of time.

98
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:58,510
Hang on. Really?
After we listened to all your bullshit?

99
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:02,932
If you were listening to my bullshit,
I said it would not be easy.

100
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:05,935
I didn't say it would not be possible.

101
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,949
I will buy a third of them
and see what I can do.

102
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,785
Half or nothing.

103
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:27,831
And we both know that you're going
to say yes, because I was listening.

104
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,918
That's what your mother would do.

105
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:48,185
I'm such a bad person.

106
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,479
You spend all your money on my medicine.

107
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,900
- Don't talk like that.
- You would be a success without me.

108
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:57,778
- You would not have to live here.
- Not listening.

109
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,281
If I wasn't such a bad person,

110
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,408
I'd stop taking my medicine
and let you get on with your life.

111
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,870
This is my life.
This is why we came here.

112
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:10,249
To make money,
to be happy, to be healthy.

113
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,461
Besides, when I iron my shirt,
it always burns up.

114
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,673
Without you,
I would go into the world naked.

115
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:21,468
There's still some water left.

116
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,929
I will try and bring some back
before I come home.

117
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:28,600
I love you.

118
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,772
And don't worry.

119
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:38,402
I've got a feeling today
is going to be a really good day. Huh?

120
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,963
Hey!

121
00:10:58,047 --> 00:10:59,798
Ah!

122
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:05,971
All aboard the Van Damn,
the safest bus in and out of Nai-robbery!

123
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:15,647
Eh?

124
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,495
The fuck are you doing?

125
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,125
I'm thinking about Katrina Unger.

126
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,627
- What?
- Remember?

127
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,965
The first time I got my dick wet.

128
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,718
She was 16, I was 14.

129
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,303
I'd been dating her for two months,

130
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:48,889
which back then
seemed like a fucking lifetime,

131
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:53,394
and I remember thinking
I'd been wasting my time.

132
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:56,397
Buying her presents,
taking her to the movies.

133
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,361
But then...

134
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:09,576
the second I got myself
inside of her...

135
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:17,251
everything...
everything had been worth it.

136
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:20,254
Hm?

137
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,424
- Know what I did?
- What?

138
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:29,846
I went out and bought myself
a new pair of shoes.

139
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,100
Had to. I couldn't walk
in those old shoes anymore.

140
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:35,685
From that point on, everything changed.

141
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,982
I mean, I had changed. I was a man!

142
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,875
And right now, I'm thinking...

143
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,296
we need new shoes.

144
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,263
Whoo!

145
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,476
This is it, Capheus!

146
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,062
You'll never hear me complain
about success, Capheus, never!

147
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,148
- Never!
- My ancestors would haunt me

148
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:24,443
if I even thought to complain
about having too many passengers.

149
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,236
- Whoo!
- Don't complain, Jela.

150
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,030
Whoo!

151
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:31,074
Whoo!

152
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:35,787
Whoo-hoo!

153
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,208
Whoo!

154
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:44,380
Whoo! Oh, those are my-- Those are
my ancestors reminding me to be grateful,

155
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:47,257
even when I'm being whipped on the face!

156
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,051
- Whoo!
- You are crazy.

157
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:51,512
Oh, my God!

158
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,347
Oh, my God.

159
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,391
Oh, crap.

160
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,312
You made sure
we had all the permits, eh?

161
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:03,815
Yeah, we are in total compliance.
Don't worry, it will be over in a minute.

162
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,573
Good day, officers.
I'm sure you'd like to see--

163
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,075
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, happy to. Love to.

164
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:16,161
You know what? Shutting the fuck up
is a specialty of mine, so--

165
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,413
We want Van Damme.

166
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,251
Out.

167
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,462
Out, out, out, out.

168
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,008
Shut up.

169
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,678
- Follow me.
- I don't understand, sir.

170
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,931
Follow me.

171
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,979
Guys, come on.

172
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,901
It seems he's not coming back.

173
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:51,238
Van Damme always comes back.

174
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,457
Daniella, I don't think you both
were listening to me.

175
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,459
What I'm saying is that
he came to the set.

176
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:07,630
- He came to the fucking set.
- The director says he knows him.

177
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,089
Yes, he did.

178
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:13,093
And what did he say about him?

179
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,137
He said he was a great guy.

180
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,473
I'm sorry, Lito.

181
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,683
That doesn't sound like
something he would do.

182
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:22,311
Well, he did. He did.

183
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,481
I'm telling you, Daniella, over lunch...

184
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,359
he showed me how to cut a man's throat.

185
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:31,111
He put a knife on my throat.

186
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,406
Now that sounds like
something he would do.

187
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,034
- But now you're home, OK?
- You should have told me.

188
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:39,786
Taste the ceviche.

189
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:49,921
Daniella-- Good.

190
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,548
- You're an actor.
- Good?

191
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:55,427
You understand that this,
you know, set, is--

192
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:58,763
- It's a sacred space?
- Yes, exactly.

193
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,225
- I thought home was your sacred space.
- It is, Hernando.

194
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,769
But this is where I work
and it's very difficult to concentrate

195
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,856
when you have a knife-wielding
psycho ex-lover stalking you.

196
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:09,899
- You know, guys?
- Oh, my God.

197
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,235
Yeah, I mean,
it completely freaked me out.

198
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,862
Oh, my God, this is so good.

199
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,239
That's the best ceviche I've ever tasted.

200
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,242
Oy, Hernando,
you have to open a restaurant.

201
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,203
Thank you.

202
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:24,998
I mean, you are such a good cook.

203
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,209
- I'm gonna tell you my secret.
- It's very tasty.

204
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,628
Actually, this is not, uh, ceviche.

205
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,673
This is actually a mix.

206
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:38,679
So, here they are.

207
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:40,972
Yeah, great.

208
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:45,519
- Um... and I really like those ones, 42.
- Mm-hm.

209
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,813
<i>Und,</i> do you have them in yellow,
something more colorful?

210
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:50,815
- Yeah, for sure.
- Oh, great.

211
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,611
Wow.

212
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,621
Those are so you, Wolfie.

213
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:11,461
Maybe too you. You should
try something... a little different.

214
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,340
I like my shoes.

215
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:22,556
What the fuck?

216
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,726
What?

217
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,716
I have seen you before.

218
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,679
- You pray to Ganesha.
- I do.

219
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,723
If these men are allowed
to have their way,

220
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,934
you will never be allowed to pray again.

221
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,520
What?

222
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,189
They want to strip away our traditions.

223
00:18:54,272 --> 00:19:00,487
They are trying to destroy our India
and turn it into America.

224
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,448
- No, that-- That's not true.
- It is.

225
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:06,034
These are the facts.

226
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:12,916
They use their evil drug money
to buy politicians,

227
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:17,921
who are going to outlaw people like us
and temples like this.

228
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:23,343
We are pledged to come here every day
and pray for their deaths.

229
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,553
Pray with us.

230
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:29,933
Pray to Ganesha to destroy our enemy
before they destroy us.

231
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:45,407
So this is the notorious Van Damme.

232
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,371
I'm Silas Kabaka.

233
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,083
I know who you are.

234
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,462
Our reputations precede us.

235
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:07,053
You did me a great service,
though you may not even know it.

236
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:12,350
You see, the gang Superpower
had been working for me.

237
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,061
They got it in their heads
they no longer needed me,

238
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:18,648
and in one afternoon,
you destroyed whatever reputation

239
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,901
they felt they'd been building,

240
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:25,154
thereby saving me from
the incumbent messiness of betrayal.

241
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:26,531
So I said to myself,

242
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:32,704
here is a man that might be capable
of more service to someone like me.

243
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:38,209
Service that provides the kind of
remuneration that can change a man's life.

244
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,756
Thanks for the offer, but I'm OK.

245
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:56,185
You may be OK... but I know
this is not true for your mother.

246
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:03,693
We both know that
she is dying of the virus.

247
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:07,363
Unless she gets the right medication,
she'll soon be dead.

248
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:12,368
You know the problem
with buying medicine in this country

249
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:18,583
is that you never know if what
you're buying is real... or counterfeit.

250
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,812
The doctors assure me that these
will have an immediate impact

251
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,814
on your mother's health.

252
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,233
What do I have to do for them?

253
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:50,824
All you need to do is protect this bag

254
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:55,662
and make sure it arrives
at this address by midnight tonight.

255
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:11,761
Should be a rather simple task
for a man of your abilities, no?

256
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,321
What are you doing
hiding in the dark?

257
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:31,698
Waiting for you.

258
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,287
I know you've been avoiding me.

259
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:42,166
Your outburst in front
of my assistant was childish.

260
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,335
I needed to get your attention.

261
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:47,338
I have been here every night,

262
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:51,801
negotiating a very important deal
with the Americans.

263
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,972
Put the cigarette out.

264
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,100
You know I hate it when you smoke.

265
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,491
You're too late.

266
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:17,577
The auditors already know.

267
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,126
Someone in this company
has been deliberately devaluing

268
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:29,131
certain pharmaceutical stock in order
to move funds from one account to another.

269
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:33,135
This kind of transaction
happens every day.

270
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:35,011
That may be...

271
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:41,101
but this kind of transaction
is called embezzlement.

272
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:45,730
Someone is going to jail for it.

273
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,572
And I think we both know who.

274
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,208
We want the most
expensive wine you have.

275
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,836
- Felix.
- We have an amazing Bordeaux.

276
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,797
Is it the most expensive?

277
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,217
- Yes, I believe it is.
- Then we'll take it.

278
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:16,970
One time, just one night,

279
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:22,058
I want to live like I'm one of them
Arab sheiks or Russian billionaires.

280
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:24,811
Tonight, I don't want to be
just Felix Bernner.

281
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:29,232
Tonight, I say, no fucking limits!

282
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,196
Hey.

283
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:36,739
You all right?

284
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,494
Yeah, sure.

285
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,708
<i>I know what you're going through, Nomi.</i>

286
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,043
In just the span of a single day,

287
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:51,129
you can see how much more damage
the disease has done.

288
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:54,174
The tissue has nearly completely
merged the hemispheres.

289
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:57,719
I'm sure the hallucinations
are getting more and more intense.

290
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,516
And I have a feeling that you know
who started that fire.

291
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,020
I don't know anything about that.

292
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,730
Whoever they are, they aren't helping you.

293
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:14,277
I don't know what they taught you
in med school, but the word "helping"

294
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,947
doesn't mean handcuff people
and chop up their brains.

295
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,741
Michael!

296
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:24,412
Nurse, I was gonna operate
tomorrow morning,

297
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,915
but I don't think Ms. Marks here
can afford to wait.

298
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,375
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm fine. I can wait.

299
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:33,504
Cancel my rounds. Prep her for surgery.

300
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:35,298
Yes, doctor.

301
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:56,194
Sorry, lady, this is a private club.

302
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,031
I don't want to cause a scene.
I know this is a sex club.

303
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:02,909
No chicks but naked chicks.

304
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,039
My brother's in there
and I need him to come with me.

305
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:09,749
Ain't gonna happen.

306
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,378
Fuck off.

307
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:02,760
Hey, you OK?

308
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,059
You can wait here, Officer Gorski.

309
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,853
I'll go get Lieutenant Duncan.

310
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,833
Whoo!

311
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,888
Come with me.

312
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:53,936
It's OK.
This is my big sister, everyone.

313
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,647
- Hi.
- Hi, sister.

314
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,317
She doesn't mean
to make an ass out of herself.

315
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,528
She just can't seem to help it.

316
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:04,488
Father needs to talk to you.

317
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:07,075
Are you fucking kidding?

318
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:11,537
- I'll see him tomorrow.
- No. He's waiting.

319
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,290
- In the middle of something important--
- Joong-Ki!

320
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:20,046
Now.

321
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,309
Will! So good to see you.

322
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:35,728
Did you have to wait long?

323
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:38,106
No, no. It's good to see you.

324
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:40,233
I didn't know you spoke Korean.

325
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:41,817
What?

326
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:44,862
You honor us with your presence.

327
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,783
Though your wife
is a cock sucking whore.

328
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,826
Hapkido. Black belt.

329
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,331
Thirteen years. My sensei had
the foulest mouth in the entire Midwest.

330
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,376
- How's your dad?
- He's doin' good.

331
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,628
I haven't seen him
since the retirement party.

332
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:03,298
I don't think I've ever seen
so many shitfaced cops

333
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:06,134
from so many precincts in one bar.

334
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:08,177
Your dad was a legend.

335
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,976
Is. Is a legend. Sorry, Will.

336
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,480
So, uh, what can I do you for?

337
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:21,023
Uh, it's about that perp I brought in,
Jonas Maliki.

338
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:22,233
What about him?

339
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:24,944
Was just hoping I could ask him
a few questions.

340
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,404
Ah, sorry, Will, no can do.

341
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,491
It's federal.
You know how those guys are.

342
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,034
We're only holdin' him here
until he's transferred.

343
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:34,454
You should've called first.
It would've saved you a trip.

344
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:36,998
All I need is five minutes with him.
Family friend here.

345
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,334
This is a personal favor.

346
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:42,795
This look like a place
that gives a shit about personal favors?

347
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:46,174
I'm sorry, Will, but rules are rules.

348
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:49,302
Give my best to your dad.

349
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:51,304
I'll send Greg to take you out.

350
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:56,725
Damn it!

351
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,947
Will.

352
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,631
You're here.

353
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:31,302
- I can feel you.
- Yes, you can.

354
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:34,556
But you're not really here, are you?

355
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:35,764
No.

356
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,976
I'm in solitary confinement.

357
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:47,402
Angel called it "visiting."

358
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:51,573
Members of a cluster do it instinctively
and others, like us, outside the cluster,

359
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:55,284
can visit if they've made visual contact,
eye-to-eye.

360
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,211
This is cold.

361
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,630
How can I feel this unless I'm here?

362
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:09,591
Because I feel it.

363
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:14,220
No, this doesn't make sense.

364
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:17,932
- You just spoke Korean, Will.
- I can't speak Korean.

365
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,184
Yes, you can,
and when you get it, you will.

366
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:21,519
Get what?

367
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:24,230
You are no longer just you.

368
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:28,401
Mr. Gorski?
Will you come with me, please?

369
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:39,537
<i>OK.</i>

370
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:42,873
It was so dramatic, Dad.

371
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,378
Sun made an absolute spectacle of herself.

372
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:50,506
- Really embarrassed me and--
- Shut the hell up!

373
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:55,010
Do you have no idea what you have done?

374
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:02,017
What are you talking about?

375
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,646
Do you think I am so stupid

376
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:08,732
that I don't know when
someone is stealing from me?

377
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:10,610
Stealing from my clients?!

378
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:19,452
Tomorrow the authorities are going
to come here and confiscate our records.

379
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:24,123
And your face,
the face of our company...

380
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:30,754
will be in every newspaper,
on every news program,

381
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:37,595
and everything I have built
over the past 40 years will be gone.

382
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,599
Do you understand?

383
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:45,227
Do you understand?

384
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,190
They are going to arrest you.

385
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:53,068
Oh, my God.

386
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:57,865
You taught me how to bend the rules.

387
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:00,576
Bend them, not break them.

388
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,662
This isn't all my fault!

389
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:06,957
Other people were involved.
It's not just me.

390
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:12,505
Please, Dad, I can't go to prison.

391
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,423
I'll do anything.

392
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:19,803
Even now...
you don't know how to act like a man.

393
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:27,061
What do you want me to do?
Kill myself?

394
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:31,774
I want you to think of someone
other than yourself.

395
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:37,405
For you, this is impossible,
and it's my fault.

396
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:38,989
I spoiled you.

397
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:42,493
I raised you, and I failed.

398
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:49,417
My wife, God rest her beautiful soul,

399
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,711
raised the one child

400
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:57,466
capable of seeing the only way
out of this disaster.

401
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,058
What?

402
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:08,519
Did you say a way out?

403
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:14,108
Sun. Sun has a way out?

404
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:26,036
Because Father rarely even admits
he has a daughter...

405
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:31,208
because no one knows who I am
or what I do at this company,

406
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:35,087
if I confess to your crime,

407
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,216
the company may be able
to survive the scandal.

408
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,054
Oh, my God.

409
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:51,479
Sun... you can save us?

410
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,149
Please, Sun.

411
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,572
Please save me. Please, Sun.

412
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:06,869
Please, save me. Please.

413
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:33,813
Jonas?

414
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,566
- Will.
- The fuck?

415
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,360
We don't have much time.

416
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:40,986
I tried to contact you.

417
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:43,823
Visiting is not calling
or texting someone.

418
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:48,035
It's not something you make happen.
It is something you let happen.

419
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:51,497
It took me quite some time
to understand the difference.

420
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,499
I'm hoping it won't take you as long.

421
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,878
You also have to learn the difference
between "visiting" and "sharing."

422
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,921
Visiting is what we're doing now.

423
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:02,090
Sharing is something
you can only do inside your cluster,

424
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:05,678
accessing each other's knowledge,
language, skill--

425
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,055
- What's a cluster?
- You have seven other selves now,

426
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:10,307
but unless you hurry,
there's only going to be six.

427
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,351
One of you is about to be destroyed.

428
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:16,188
I told you when we first met,
her name is Nomi Marks.

429
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,315
She lives in San Francisco.

430
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,650
You have to save her, Will,

431
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:22,570
and in so doing, save yourself.

432
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,823
Wait, wait! Jonas!

433
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:34,248
Jonas.

434
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,794
<i>OK, this is it.</i>

435
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,338
Doctor's getting ready.

436
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:42,924
No.

437
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:47,595
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

438
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:49,555
- Don't, please. Please.
- It's OK.

439
00:36:49,638 --> 00:36:52,474
- Relax. We're not gonna hurt you.
- Please, please, no.

440
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:57,104
- No, no, no.
- You are OK.

441
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:59,106
Please don't do this. Please.

442
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:01,984
Please don't. Please don't. Please!

443
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,861
- Please!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

444
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:05,237
No.

445
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,489
- It's OK, it's OK.
- OK.

446
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,409
No. You're murdering me.

447
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:13,746
Don't say that.
We are helping you.

448
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,708
- It's for your own good, believe me.
- No.

449
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:20,753
Oh, God! Oh, God, somebody help me.

450
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:28,176
- Somebody help me!
- Who are you?

451
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:50,282
Help me.

452
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,746
Fuck!

453
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:08,069
I remember... what it felt like
to be loved by her.

454
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:12,031
It was a long time ago...

455
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:16,660
but I still remember that feeling.

456
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,420
Now we both know...
how it feels to lose it.

457
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,188
<i>Riley, it's Dad.</i>

458
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,983
<i>God, I hope you get this.</i>

459
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,111
<i>I wanted you to be the first to know.</i>

460
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:54,239
<i>Riles, they want me back</i>
<i>with the symphony.</i>

461
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:57,409
<i>Said they couldn't imagine</i>
<i>playing Beethoven without me.</i>

462
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,124
<i>I know it's hard for you</i>
<i>to come home, but...</i>

463
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:06,043
<i>Well, you know how much I love you</i>
<i>and what it would mean to me</i>

464
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:10,131
<i>to look out past the lights and know</i>
<i>you were there, you were listening.</i>

465
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:14,843
<i>OK. I hope you're OK.</i>

466
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:17,721
<i>Love you, Dad.</i>

467
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,840
Ooh! Oh, Shugs!

468
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:56,635
Oh, tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me! Aah!

469
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,805
Shh! Shh!

470
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:04,267
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Fuck...

471
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:06,728
- Shh!
- Yeah! Aah!

472
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:10,273
- Yeah! Oh, I fucking love you, Shugs.
- Shh!

473
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:12,985
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh!

474
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:14,945
- Come on, Shugsie.
- I fucking am!

475
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:16,989
Oh, come on, Shugsie!

476
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:20,492
Come on! Yeah! Oh, yeah.

477
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,829
Yeah! Oh, yeah.

478
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:25,956
I'm gonna fucking come,
I'm gonna come.

479
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,292
- No, not yet, not yet! Not yet!
- I'm gonna fucking come!

480
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,550
- Come on!
- One song!

481
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:39,511
- I'm too drunk.
- One song. I know you want to!

482
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:42,639
Too drunk is why karaoke was born!

483
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:45,350
Come on, get up!

484
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:51,982
Yeah!

485
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:55,610
Hey, hey, hey!

486
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,455
Wolfgang.

487
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:14,504
Fuck you!

488
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:17,507
Fuck you!

489
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:20,594
Yeah! Yeah!

490
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,402
Ah, come on.

491
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:21,529
Oh, my gosh! I love this song!

492
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:26,534
Hey, hey!

493
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:36,795
Wolfie!

494
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:25,088
Kala?

495
00:46:26,423 --> 00:46:28,967
You were singing in English and dancing.

496
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:34,055
I was dreaming.

497
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:36,433
You were smiling at someone.

498
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:38,810
Oh, dear.

499
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:41,729
I have never seen you smile like that.

500
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,400
OK, was it Rajan?

501
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:50,632
Come on. Come on.

502
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,249
Oh...

503
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,168
What just happened?

504
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:52,193
Dr. Metzger is freaking out.
Let me know when you find out anything.

505
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:53,361
Sure.

506
00:48:55,656 --> 00:48:58,783
Excuse me, Miss?
Do you need help, Miss?

507
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:01,578
Excuse me! Officers!

508
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:03,079
She's mine. I've got her.

509
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:08,293
Ms. Keene, I told you
I'd take you outside.

510
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:14,007
I gotcha. I gotcha.

511
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,467
OK. OK.

512
00:49:27,604 --> 00:49:30,357
OK, could use a little bit of luck here.

513
00:49:31,441 --> 00:49:32,693
OK.

514
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:37,489
Excuse me. Hey.
Hey! Hey, you two!

515
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:41,075
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
We really need this now. I'm sorry.

516
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,785
Sorry, thank you.

517
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:46,289
Castro, please!

518
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:48,750
Oh, God!

519
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:52,462
- Oh!
- OK, OK.

520
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:54,172
Thank you.

521
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:56,591
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

522
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:00,053
It's OK. I love you.

523
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:01,429
I love you.

524
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:06,476
Come on. I gotcha.

525
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,687
I gotcha. Come on, you're safe.

526
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,566
You're safe. OK? OK.

527
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:45,807
- Oh. Oh, I said "Hey."
- What, sweetie, what?

528
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,977
Uh... I've had this song
stuck in my-- my head all day.

529
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:57,277
- "I said 'Hey, hey.' I said 'Hey.'"
- 4 Non Blondes.

530
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,697
That's a perfect soundtrack
for a lobotomy.

531
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:03,324
Mm.

532
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:34,147
What's going on?

533
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:40,153
What's going on?

534
