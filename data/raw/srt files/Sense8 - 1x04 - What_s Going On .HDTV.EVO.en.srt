00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:11,012
I mean, everyone wants to believe
they'd be the hero,

3
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:14,640
that they'd join the Resistance,
try to kill Hitler.

4
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:16,934
It's such fucking bullshit.

5
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:20,187
It's obedience, not resistance.

6
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,860
That's the glue of every country,
every army, every religion in the world.

7
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,862
The fuck are you talking about, Felix?

8
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:31,156
What do you think?
I'm talking about us.

9
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,535
- I'm talking about our revolution.
- We snatched some rocks.

10
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:40,416
Mark my words, Wolfie,
this score is going to change our lives.

11
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:43,502
Not gonna change shit
if we can't sell them.

12
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:45,546
He's going to buy.

13
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,591
Just relax. Let me do the talking.

14
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:57,016
- Thank you for waiting.
- Not a problem.

15
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,603
It's nice here, but you know
there's a bigger one in Mettre?

16
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:03,647
That one smells like piss.

17
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,734
The drunks from the park
use it as a toilet.

18
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:07,944
I like this one better.

19
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:12,406
Whenever I have a difficult
decision to make, I come here.

20
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,326
This place brings a clarity
to any decision.

21
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,914
- What were you thinking about?
- My mother.

22
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:23,459
- Did she die in the Holocaust?
- No, she lived.

23
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,712
She fell in love with an Englishman
and ran away with him

24
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,048
against her parents' wishes.

25
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:34,303
I think how much courage she had
to make that decision.

26
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:39,142
After the war, she came back
to find her parents, but she never did.

27
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,770
- And she never left Berlin again.
- Mm.

28
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:47,942
Our existence depends
on sheer implausibility,

29
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:53,030
which I'm sure is exactly
how your merchandise

30
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,075
found its way into your pocket.

31
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,536
Does that mean you're interested?

32
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,540
I would like to see them.

33
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,130
Please, not here.

34
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,466
Any talk of money
seems unimportant here.

35
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,723
<i>We never discuss money.</i>

36
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,558
We have no interest in money.

37
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:25,146
All we are interested in
is making sure that you and your son...

38
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,106
- And your daughter.
- ...are happy.

39
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,274
OK, then we are all in accordance with...

40
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:31,527
Not exactly. Ah.

41
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,532
We have spoken to the priest, uh,

42
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:39,535
- concerning the, uh...
- Adjustment to the service.

43
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,287
Uh, this is my fault.

44
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,414
I wanted to add an exchange of rings.

45
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:48,502
Ah, this is a Hindu wedding ceremony.
There are no rings.

46
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,587
- I know.
- There are traditions.

47
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:54,424
Yes, but we are trying to start them
on a path to the 21st century,

48
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:56,510
- not the 16th.
- Of course.

49
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,387
And the priest is ready to accommodate.

50
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,349
It's just that with both services,
it appears the ceremony...

51
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,686
- Will be over six hours.
- Six hours?

52
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:08,856
There are certain shortcuts
that others have preferred.

53
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:09,982
How short?

54
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,236
It depends entirely on how much
you value the priest conducting it.

55
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,486
How much?

56
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,906
The more you give him,
the shorter the ceremony.

57
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:18,824
The sooner everyone can get to dancing.

58
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:23,162
Six hours is the starting point.
Pay him double, out in three.

59
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,706
And how much to not perform it at all?

60
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:31,045
You couldn't afford it.

61
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,052
This is important to me.

62
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:40,429
Married men in India don't wear rings.

63
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,598
There is nothing to show their commitment.

64
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,475
That is why I want one.

65
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,691
I want to remember this night
for the rest of my life,

66
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,069
and I don't want it to be a secret.

67
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:59,364
I want the whole world to know
I'm bound to this woman.

68
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,204
Now and forever.

69
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,577
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

70
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,624
So smart and so strong.

71
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,338
Is that why my father hates me?

72
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,382
He doesn't hate you, my child.

73
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:00,301
You must never think that.

74
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:05,097
- He loves you.
- He never came to any of my matches.

75
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,059
He went to all of Joong-Ki's matches.

76
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:12,313
You cannot be jealous of your brother.

77
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:17,860
Do not blame him
for how much Father loves him.

78
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:21,571
It is natural for fathers
to be close to their sons.

79
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,242
He's planning on Joong-Ki
taking over the company.

80
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:32,375
If I cannot be there
to help Father realize his dream...

81
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,794
you must be there for me.

82
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:41,300
Please, Sun, take care of your brother.

83
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:50,100
Do this for me.

84
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:04,407
We, like these books,
or these diamonds,

85
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:08,535
have the secrets of our past
hidden inside us.

86
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,206
You think a lot about the past, don't you?

87
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:16,168
Without the past,
there would be nothing to think about,

88
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,795
let alone someone to think it.

89
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,673
Deep.

90
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:25,386
You certainly weren't lying.
These are beauties.

91
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:28,764
Shall I be honest?

92
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:31,641
I know I was probably
the last on your list.

93
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:36,939
I'm an outsider to you, but I think I know
where these rocks came from.

94
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:42,486
Out of Mumbai, I'm guessing, and I know
who's going to come looking for them.

95
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:47,324
They will not be easy to move,
unless I recut them.

96
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:51,745
Recut, they will have
a fraction of their worth.

97
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,291
Let's go, Felix.
I knew this was a waste of time.

98
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,710
Hang on. Really?
After we listened to all your bullshit?

99
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:03,132
If you were listening to my bullshit,
I said it would not be easy.

100
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:06,135
I didn't say it would not be possible.

101
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:20,149
I will buy a third of them
and see what I can do.

102
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,985
Half or nothing.

103
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:28,031
And we both know that you're going
to say yes, because I was listening.

104
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,118
That's what your mother would do.

105
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,385
I'm such a bad person.

106
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,679
You spend all your money on my medicine.

107
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:55,100
- Don't talk like that.
- You would be a success without me.

108
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,978
- You would not have to live here.
- Not listening.

109
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,481
If I wasn't such a bad person,

110
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,608
I'd stop taking my medicine
and let you get on with your life.

111
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:07,070
This is my life.
This is why we came here.

112
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:10,449
To make money,
to be happy, to be healthy.

113
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:14,661
Besides, when I iron my shirt,
it always burns up.

114
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:17,873
Without you,
I would go into the world naked.

115
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,668
There's still some water left.

116
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,129
I will try and bring some back
before I come home.

117
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:28,800
I love you.

118
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,972
And don't worry.

119
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:38,602
I've got a feeling today
is going to be a really good day. Huh?

120
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,163
Hey!

121
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,998
Ah!

122
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:06,171
All aboard the Van Damn,
the safest bus in and out of Nai-robbery!

123
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:15,847
Eh?

124
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,695
The fuck are you doing?

125
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,325
I'm thinking about Katrina Unger.

126
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,827
- What?
- Remember?

127
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:42,165
The first time I got my dick wet.

128
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,918
She was 16, I was 14.

129
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,503
I'd been dating her for two months,

130
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,089
which back then
seemed like a fucking lifetime,

131
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:53,594
and I remember thinking
I'd been wasting my time.

132
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:56,597
Buying her presents,
taking her to the movies.

133
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:02,561
But then...

134
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:09,776
the second I got myself
inside of her...

135
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:17,451
everything...
everything had been worth it.

136
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:20,454
Hm?

137
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:23,624
- Know what I did?
- What?

138
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:30,046
I went out and bought myself
a new pair of shoes.

139
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,300
Had to. I couldn't walk
in those old shoes anymore.

140
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:35,885
From that point on, everything changed.

141
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:40,182
I mean, I had changed. I was a man!

142
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,075
And right now, I'm thinking...

143
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,496
we need new shoes.

144
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,463
Whoo!

145
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,676
This is it, Capheus!

146
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,262
You'll never hear me complain
about success, Capheus, never!

147
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,348
- Never!
- My ancestors would haunt me

148
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,643
if I even thought to complain
about having too many passengers.

149
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,436
- Whoo!
- Don't complain, Jela.

150
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,230
Whoo!

151
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,274
Whoo!

152
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:35,987
Whoo-hoo!

153
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,408
Whoo!

154
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:44,580
Whoo! Oh, those are my... Those are
my ancestors reminding me to be grateful,

155
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:47,457
even when I'm being whipped on the face!

156
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,251
- Whoo!
- You are crazy.

157
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,712
Oh, my God!

158
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,547
Oh, my God.

159
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,591
Oh, crap.

160
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,528
You made sure
we had all the permits, eh?

161
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:04,015
Yeah, we are in total compliance.
Don't worry, it will be over in a minute.

162
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:10,773
Good day, officers.
I'm sure you'd like to see...

163
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:13,275
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, happy to. Love to.

164
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:16,361
You know what? Shutting the fuck up
is a specialty of mine, so...

165
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:17,613
We want Van Damme.

166
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,451
Out.

167
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,662
Out, out, out, out.

168
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:30,208
Shut up.

169
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,878
- Follow me.
- I don't understand, sir.

170
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:36,131
Follow me.

171
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,179
Guys, come on.

172
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:48,101
It seems he's not coming back.

173
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,438
Van Damme always comes back.

174
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:01,657
Daniella, I don't think you both
were listening to me.

175
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,659
What I'm saying is that
he came to the set.

176
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:07,830
- He came to the fucking set.
- The director says he knows him.

177
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,289
Yes, he did.

178
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,293
And what did he say about him?

179
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,337
He said he was a great guy.

180
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,673
I'm sorry, Lito.

181
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:19,883
That doesn't sound like
something he would do.

182
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,511
Well, he did. He did.

183
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:25,681
I'm telling you, Daniella, over lunch...

184
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,559
he showed me how to cut a man's throat.

185
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,311
He put a knife on my throat.

186
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,606
Now that sounds like
something he would do.

187
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,234
- But now you're home, OK?
- You should have told me.

188
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,986
Taste the ceviche.

189
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,121
Daniella... Good.

190
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,748
- You're an actor.
- Good?

191
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:55,627
You understand that this,
you know, set, is...

192
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,963
- It's a sacred space?
- Yes, exactly.

193
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:02,425
- I thought home was your sacred space.
- It is, Hernando.

194
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,989
But this is where I work
and it's very difficult to concentrate

195
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:08,056
when you have a knife-wielding
psycho ex-lover stalking you.

196
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,099
- You know, guys?
- Oh, my God.

197
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,435
Yeah, I mean,
it completely freaked me out.

198
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,062
Oh, my God, this is so good.

199
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:16,439
That's the best ceviche I've ever tasted.

200
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:19,442
Oy, Hernando,
you have to open a restaurant.

201
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:21,403
Thank you.

202
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:25,198
I mean, you are such a good cook.

203
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,409
- I'm gonna tell you my secret.
- It's very tasty.

204
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:29,828
Actually, this is not, uh, ceviche.

205
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,873
This is actually a mix.

206
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:38,879
So, here they are.

207
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,172
Yeah, great.

208
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:45,719
- Um... and I really like those ones, 42.
- Mm-hm.

209
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:49,013
<i>Und,</i> do you have them in yellow,
something more colorful?

210
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,015
- Yeah, for sure.
- Oh, great.

211
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,811
Wow.

212
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,821
Those are so you, Wolfie.

213
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:11,661
Maybe too you. You should
try something... a little different.

214
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,540
I like my shoes.

215
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:22,756
What the fuck?

216
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,926
What?

217
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,916
I have seen you before.

218
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,879
- You pray to Ganesha.
- I do.

219
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,923
If these men are allowed
to have their way,

220
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,134
you will never be allowed to pray again.

221
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,720
What?

222
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:54,389
They want to strip away our traditions.

223
00:18:54,472 --> 00:19:00,687
They are trying to destroy our India
and turn it into America.

224
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,648
- No, that... That's not true.
- It is.

225
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:06,234
These are the facts.

226
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:13,116
They use their evil drug money
to buy politicians,

227
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:18,121
who are going to outlaw people like us
and temples like this.

228
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:23,543
We are pledged to come here every day
and pray for their deaths.

229
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,753
Pray with us.

230
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:30,133
Pray to Ganesha to destroy our enemy
before they destroy us.

231
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,607
So this is the notorious Van Damme.

232
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:51,571
I'm Silas Kabaka.

233
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,283
I know who you are.

234
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,662
Our reputations precede us.

235
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,253
You did me a great service,
though you may not even know it.

236
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:12,550
You see, the gang Superpower
had been working for me.

237
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:15,261
They got it in their heads
they no longer needed me,

238
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,848
and in one afternoon,
you destroyed whatever reputation

239
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,101
they felt they'd been building,

240
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:25,354
thereby saving me from
the incumbent messiness of betrayal.

241
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:26,731
So I said to myself,

242
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:32,904
here is a man that might be capable
of more service to someone like me.

243
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:38,409
Service that provides the kind of
remuneration that can change a man's life.

244
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,956
Thanks for the offer, but I'm OK.

245
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:56,385
You may be OK... but I know
this is not true for your mother.

246
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:03,893
We both know that
she is dying of the virus.

247
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:07,563
Unless she gets the right medication,
she'll soon be dead.

248
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,568
You know the problem
with buying medicine in this country

249
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:18,783
is that you never know if what
you're buying is real... or counterfeit.

250
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,012
The doctors assure me that these
will have an immediate impact

251
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,014
on your mother's health.

252
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:44,433
What do I have to do for them?

253
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:51,024
All you need to do is protect this bag

254
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:55,862
and make sure it arrives
at this address by midnight tonight.

255
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:11,961
Should be a rather simple task
for a man of your abilities, no?

256
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,521
What are you doing
hiding in the dark?

257
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:31,898
Waiting for you.

258
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,487
I know you've been avoiding me.

259
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:42,366
Your outburst in front
of my assistant was childish.

260
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,535
I needed to get your attention.

261
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,538
I have been here every night,

262
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:52,001
negotiating a very important deal
with the Americans.

263
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,172
Put the cigarette out.

264
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,300
You know I hate it when you smoke.

265
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:15,691
You're too late.

266
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:17,777
The auditors already know.

267
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:24,326
Someone in this company
has been deliberately devaluing

268
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:29,331
certain pharmaceutical stock in order
to move funds from one account to another.

269
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:33,335
This kind of transaction
happens every day.

270
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,211
That may be...

271
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:41,301
but this kind of transaction
is called embezzlement.

272
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:45,930
Someone is going to jail for it.

273
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:54,772
And I think we both know who.

274
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,408
We want the most
expensive wine you have.

275
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,036
- Felix.
- We have an amazing Bordeaux.

276
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,997
Is it the most expensive?

277
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,417
- Yes, I believe it is.
- Then we'll take it.

278
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,170
One time, just one night,

279
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:22,258
I want to live like I'm one of them
Arab sheiks or Russian billionaires.

280
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:25,011
Tonight, I don't want to be
just Felix Bernner.

281
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:29,432
Tonight, I say, no fucking limits!

282
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:34,396
Hey.

283
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,939
You all right?

284
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,694
Yeah, sure.

285
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,908
<i>I know what you're going through, Nomi.</i>

286
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:48,312
In just the span of a single day,

287
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:51,329
you can see how much more damage
the disease has done.

288
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:54,374
The tissue has nearly completely
merged the hemispheres.

289
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:57,919
I'm sure the hallucinations
are getting more and more intense.

290
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,716
And I have a feeling that you know
who started that fire.

291
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:07,220
I don't know anything about that.

292
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,983
Whoever they are, they aren't helping you.

293
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:14,477
I don't know what they taught you
in med school, but the word "helping"

294
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,147
doesn't mean handcuff people
and chop up their brains.

295
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,941
Michael!

296
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:24,612
Nurse, I was gonna operate
tomorrow morning,

297
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:27,115
but I don't think Ms. Marks here
can afford to wait.

298
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,575
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm fine. I can wait.

299
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:33,704
Cancel my rounds. Prep her for surgery.

300
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:35,498
Yes, doctor.

301
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,394
Sorry, lady, this is a private club.

302
00:25:56,478 --> 00:26:00,231
I don't want to cause a scene.
I know this is a sex club.

303
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:03,109
No chicks but naked chicks.

304
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,239
My brother's in there
and I need him to come with me.

305
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:09,949
Ain't gonna happen.

306
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,578
Fuck off.

307
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,960
Hey, you OK?

308
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,259
You can wait here, Officer Gorski.

309
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,053
I'll go get Lieutenant Duncan.

310
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,033
Whoo!

311
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,088
Come with me.

312
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:54,136
It's OK.
This is my big sister, everyone.

313
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,847
- Hi.
- Hi, sister.

314
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:59,517
She doesn't mean
to make an ass out of herself.

315
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:02,728
She just can't seem to help it.

316
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,688
Father needs to talk to you.

317
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:07,275
Are you fucking kidding?

318
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:11,737
- I'll see him tomorrow.
- No. He's waiting.

319
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,490
- In the middle of something important...
- Joong-Ki!

320
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,246
Now.

321
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,509
Will! So good to see you.

322
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:35,928
Did you have to wait long?

323
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,306
No, no. It's good to see you.

324
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,433
I didn't know you spoke Korean.

325
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:42,017
What?

326
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:45,062
You honor us with your presence.

327
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,983
Though your wife
is a cock sucking whore.

328
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:51,026
Hapkido. Black belt.

329
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,531
Thirteen years. My sensei had
the foulest mouth in the entire Midwest.

330
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:58,576
- How's your dad?
- He's doin' good.

331
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,828
I haven't seen him
since the retirement party.

332
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:03,498
I don't think I've ever seen
so many shitfaced cops

333
00:29:03,581 --> 00:29:06,334
from so many precincts in one bar.

334
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,377
Your dad was a legend.

335
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:15,176
Is. Is a legend. Sorry, Will.

336
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,680
So, uh, what can I do you for?

337
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:21,223
Uh, it's about that perp I brought in,
Jonas Maliki.

338
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:22,433
What about him?

339
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:25,144
Was just hoping I could ask him
a few questions.

340
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,604
Ah, sorry, Will, no can do.

341
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:29,691
It's federal.
You know how those guys are.

342
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:32,234
We're only holdin' him here
until he's transferred.

343
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:34,654
You should've called first.
It would've saved you a trip.

344
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:37,198
All I need is five minutes with him.
Family friend here.

345
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,534
This is a personal favor.

346
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:42,995
This look like a place
that gives a shit about personal favors?

347
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:46,374
I'm sorry, Will, but rules are rules.

348
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,502
Give my best to your dad.

349
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,504
I'll send Greg to take you out.

350
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,925
Damn it!

351
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:10,147
Will.

352
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,831
You're here.

353
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:31,502
- I can feel you.
- Yes, you can.

354
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:34,756
But you're not really here, are you?

355
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:35,964
No.

356
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:39,176
I'm in solitary confinement.

357
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:47,602
Angel called it "visiting."

358
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:51,773
Members of a cluster do it instinctively
and others, like us, outside the cluster,

359
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:55,484
can visit if they've made visual contact,
eye-to-eye.

360
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,411
This is cold.

361
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:07,830
How can I feel this unless I'm here?

362
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:09,791
Because I feel it.

363
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,420
No, this doesn't make sense.

364
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:18,132
- You just spoke Korean, Will.
- I can't speak Korean.

365
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:20,384
Yes, you can,
and when you get it, you will.

366
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:21,719
Get what?

367
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:24,430
You are no longer just you.

368
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,601
Mr. Gorski?
Will you come with me, please?

369
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:39,737
<i>OK.</i>

370
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:43,073
It was so dramatic, Dad.

371
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,578
Sun made an absolute spectacle of herself.

372
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,706
- Really embarrassed me and...
- Shut the hell up!

373
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:55,210
Do you have no idea what you have done?

374
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:02,217
What are you talking about?

375
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:04,846
Do you think I am so stupid

376
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:08,932
that I don't know when
someone is stealing from me?

377
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:10,810
Stealing from my clients?!

378
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,652
Tomorrow the authorities are going
to come here and confiscate our records.

379
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:24,323
And your face,
the face of our company...

380
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:30,954
will be in every newspaper,
on every news program,

381
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:37,795
and everything I have built
over the past 40 years will be gone.

382
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,799
Do you understand?

383
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:45,427
Do you understand?

384
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:49,390
They are going to arrest you.

385
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,268
Oh, my God.

386
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,065
You taught me how to bend the rules.

387
00:32:58,148 --> 00:33:00,776
Bend them, not break them.

388
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,862
This isn't all my fault!

389
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:07,157
Other people were involved.
It's not just me.

390
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:12,705
Please, Dad, I can't go to prison.

391
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,623
I'll do anything.

392
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:20,003
Even now...
you don't know how to act like a man.

393
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:27,261
What do you want me to do?
Kill myself?

394
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:31,974
I want you to think of someone
other than yourself.

395
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:37,605
For you, this is impossible,
and it's my fault.

396
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:39,189
I spoiled you.

397
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:42,693
I raised you, and I failed.

398
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:49,617
My wife, God rest her beautiful soul,

399
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,911
raised the one child

400
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:57,666
capable of seeing the only way
out of this disaster.

401
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,258
What?

402
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:08,719
Did you say a way out?

403
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:14,308
Sun. Sun has a way out?

404
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:26,236
Because Father rarely even admits
he has a daughter...

405
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:31,408
because no one knows who I am
or what I do at this company,

406
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:35,287
if I confess to your crime,

407
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,416
the company may be able
to survive the scandal.

408
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,254
Oh, my God.

409
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:51,679
Sun... you can save us?

410
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,349
Please, Sun.

411
00:34:58,435 --> 00:35:01,772
Please save me. Please, Sun.

412
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:07,069
Please, save me. Please.

413
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,013
Jonas?

414
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:37,766
- Will.
- The fuck?

415
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,560
We don't have much time.

416
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:41,186
I tried to contact you.

417
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:44,023
Visiting is not calling
or texting someone.

418
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:48,235
It's not something you make happen.
It is something you let happen.

419
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:51,697
It took me quite some time
to understand the difference.

420
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,699
I'm hoping it won't take you as long.

421
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:57,136
You also have to learn the difference
between "visiting" and "sharing."

422
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,121
Visiting is what we're doing now.

423
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:02,290
Sharing is something
you can only do inside your cluster,

424
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:05,878
accessing each other's knowledge,
language, skill...

425
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:08,255
- What's a cluster?
- You have seven other selves now,

426
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,507
but unless you hurry,
there's only going to be six.

427
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:12,551
One of you is about to be destroyed.

428
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:16,388
I told you when we first met,
her name is Nomi Marks.

429
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:18,515
She lives in San Francisco.

430
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,850
You have to save her, Will,

431
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,770
and in so doing, save yourself.

432
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:26,023
Wait, wait! Jonas!

433
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:34,448
Jonas.

434
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,994
<i>OK, this is it.</i>

435
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:41,538
Doctor's getting ready.

436
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,124
No.

437
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,795
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

438
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,755
- Don't, please. Please.
- It's OK.

439
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,674
- Relax. We're not gonna hurt you.
- Please, please, no.

440
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,304
- No, no, no.
- You are OK.

441
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:59,306
Please don't do this. Please.

442
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:02,184
Please don't. Please don't. Please!

443
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,061
- Please!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

444
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:05,437
No.

445
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,689
- It's OK, it's OK.
- OK.

446
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:10,609
No. You're murdering me.

447
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,946
Don't say that.
We are helping you.

448
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:17,908
- It's for your own good, believe me.
- No.

449
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:20,953
Oh, God! Oh, God, somebody help me.

450
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:28,376
- Somebody help me!
- Who are you?

451
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,482
Help me.

452
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:55,946
Fuck!

453
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:08,269
I remember... what it felt like
to be loved by her.

454
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:12,231
It was a long time ago...

455
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,860
but I still remember that feeling.

456
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,620
Now we both know...
how it feels to lose it.

457
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:45,388
<i>Riley, it's Dad.</i>

458
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:48,183
<i>God, I hope you get this.</i>

459
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,311
<i>I wanted you to be the first to know.</i>

460
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:54,439
<i>Riles, they want me back</i>
<i>with the symphony.</i>

461
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:57,609
<i>Said they couldn't imagine</i>
<i>playing Beethoven without me.</i>

462
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:03,324
<i>I know it's hard for you</i>
<i>to come home, but...</i>

463
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:06,243
<i>Well, you know how much I love you</i>
<i>and what it would mean to me</i>

464
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:10,331
<i>to look out past the lights and know</i>
<i>you were there, you were listening.</i>

465
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:15,043
<i>OK. I hope you're OK.</i>

466
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:17,921
<i>Love you, Dad.</i>

467
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:53,040
Ooh! Oh, Shugs!

468
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:56,835
Oh, tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me! Aah!

469
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,005
Shh! Shh!

470
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:04,467
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Fuck...

471
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,928
- Shh!
- Yeah! Aah!

472
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:10,473
- Yeah! Oh, I fucking love you, Shugs.
- Shh!

473
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:13,185
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh!

474
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,145
- Come on, Shugsie.
- I fucking am!

475
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,189
Oh, come on, Shugsie!

476
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:20,692
Come on! Yeah! Oh, yeah.

477
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,029
Yeah! Oh, yeah.

478
00:41:24,112 --> 00:41:26,156
I'm gonna fucking come,
I'm gonna come.

479
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,492
- No, not yet, not yet! Not yet!
- I'm gonna fucking come!

480
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:36,750
- Come on!
- One song!

481
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,711
- I'm too drunk.
- One song. I know you want to!

482
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:42,839
Too drunk is why karaoke was born!

483
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:45,550
Come on, get up!

484
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:52,182
Yeah!

485
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:55,810
Hey, hey, hey!

486
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,655
Wolfgang.

487
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:14,704
Fuck you!

488
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:17,707
Fuck you!

489
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,794
Yeah! Yeah!

490
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,602
Ah, come on.

491
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:21,729
Oh, my gosh! I love this song!

492
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,734
Hey, hey!

493
00:43:34,326 --> 00:43:36,995
Wolfie!

494
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:25,288
Kala?

495
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:29,167
You were singing in English and dancing.

496
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:34,255
I was dreaming.

497
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:36,633
You were smiling at someone.

498
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,010
Oh, dear.

499
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:41,929
I have never seen you smile like that.

500
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:45,600
OK, was it Rajan?

501
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:50,832
Come on. Come on.

502
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:24,449
Oh...

503
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:27,368
What just happened?

504
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:52,393
Dr. Metzger is freaking out.
Let me know when you find out anything.

505
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:53,561
Sure.

506
00:48:55,856 --> 00:48:58,983
Excuse me, Miss?
Do you need help, Miss?

507
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:01,778
Excuse me! Officers!

508
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:03,279
She's mine. I've got her.

509
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:08,493
Ms. Keene, I told you
I'd take you outside.

510
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:14,207
I gotcha. I gotcha.

511
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,667
OK. OK.

512
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:30,557
OK, could use a little bit of luck here.

513
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:32,893
OK.

514
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:37,689
Excuse me. Hey.
Hey! Hey, you two!

515
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:41,275
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
We really need this now. I'm sorry.

516
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,985
Sorry, thank you.

517
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:46,489
Castro, please!

518
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:48,950
Oh, God!

519
00:49:49,826 --> 00:49:52,662
- Oh!
- OK, OK.

520
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:54,372
Thank you.

521
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:56,791
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

522
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,253
It's OK. I love you.

523
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:01,629
I love you.

524
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:06,676
Come on. I gotcha.

525
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,887
I gotcha. Come on, you're safe.

526
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,766
You're safe. OK? OK.

527
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:46,007
- Oh. Oh, I said "Hey."
- What, sweetie, what?

528
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,177
Uh... I've had this song
stuck in my... my head all day.

529
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:57,477
- "I said 'Hey, hey.' I said 'Hey.'"
- 4 Non Blondes.

530
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,897
That's a perfect soundtrack
for a lobotomy.

531
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:03,524
Mm.

532
00:51:31,803 --> 00:51:34,347
What's going on?

533
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:40,353
What's going on?
