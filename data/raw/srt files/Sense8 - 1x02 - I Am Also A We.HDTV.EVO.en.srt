00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:08,685
It was the same woman from my dream,
I'm sure of it. The same face.

3
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,313
You gotta stop watching all those
cop shows. They will mess you up.

4
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,316
I feel like I know her,
I just don't remember from where.

5
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,943
Maybe someone from your criminal past.

6
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,905
- I wasn't a criminal.
- No. Activist.

7
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,365
Hacktivist.

8
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:25,451
- Reformed, paroled, legal.
- Uh-huh.

9
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:28,830
And what about all these
security companies that you hack for?

10
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:31,457
Well, it's not hacking
if you get paid for it.

11
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,418
Anyway, I thought I knew her
from one of my client companies,

12
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:36,212
but no, that's not it.

13
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,297
You've led a lot of different lives.

14
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:39,632
- So have you.
- Me?

15
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:42,301
I've been working at the same bookstore
since you met me,

16
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:45,054
but not for much longer
if I don't shake my ass.

17
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,973
Oh... Wait, wait.

18
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,945
OK, but tell me honestly,
am I sounding crazy?

19
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,698
Maybe you should write about it.

20
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,867
I am.

21
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,620
Well, it is that time of year.
You always go a little crazy at Pride.

22
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,372
You know why.

23
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:14,709
Honey, if I had your parents,
I'd be more than a little crazy.

24
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:17,378
- I'd be homicidal.
- Mm.

25
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:24,427
You got a funny look
in your eye, Will.

26
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,303
You hot for me or somethin'?

27
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:28,055
I know I'm USDA prime cut,

28
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:30,057
but you should know
I don't swing that way.

29
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:33,143
Thanks for clearing that up.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,565
Ain't gonna be good for my rep
having no 5-0 sittin' bedside.

31
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,943
Yeah, it's not helping me much either.

32
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,403
So you think you own me now
or somethin'?

33
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:43,487
No...

34
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,157
What I did for you
I would've done for anybody.

35
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,368
So what, then?

36
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:55,040
I was just thinking about
what you said in the car...

37
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,835
about your dad being shot.

38
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,922
Long time ago.

39
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:02,632
Things ain't no different.

40
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,884
My dad was shot.

41
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,302
Dead?

42
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:12,976
Some parts of him.
Finished his career.

43
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,188
Cops get shot,
hear about it on the news all day.

44
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:21,901
We get shot all the time,
but we don't mean nothin' to nobody.

45
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:28,783
Will, tell me about your gangsta days.

46
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:35,456
My kid? My fuckin' kid?

47
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,958
What are you thinking?

48
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,543
Shoplifting, for Chrissakes?

49
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,171
You know who I am? Do you?

50
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,757
The matter with you?

51
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:48,719
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,024
I don't know what he's thinkin'.

53
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,992
Hey! Hey!

54
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:15,162
This fuckin' kid.

55
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,247
You picked the lock?

56
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,001
My dad was always workin'.
I was always waitin'.

57
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,461
Not much else to play with
at a police station.

58
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,839
Yeah, Will, you know
you gotta teach me that trick.

59
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,800
All right.

60
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:30,302
I should go.

61
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:33,764
Hey.

62
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,183
I don't owe you for what you did...

63
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,270
but you should know
I won't ever forget it.

64
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:49,072
I've been thinking about my life,

65
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:52,282
and all of the mistakes that I've made.

66
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,375
The ones that stay with me,
the ones that I regret,

67
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,128
are the ones that I made
because of fear.

68
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:17,641
For a long time,
I was afraid to be who I am

69
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,103
because I was taught by my parents

70
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:24,523
that there's something wrong
with someone like me.

71
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,113
<i>Something offensive,</i>
<i>something you would avoid,</i>

72
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,073
<i>maybe even pity.</i>

73
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,993
Something that you could never love.

74
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:44,251
My mom, she's a fan
of St. Thomas Aquinas.

75
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:47,088
She calls pride a sin.

76
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,049
And of all the venal and mortal sins,

77
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,844
St. Thomas saw pride
as the queen of the seven deadlies.

78
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,220
Wolfgang!

79
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:58,015
<i>He saw it as the ultimate gateway sin</i>

80
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,309
<i>that would turn you quickly</i>
<i>into a sinaholic.</i>

81
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:03,479
The greatest box man in the world!

82
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:09,110
But hating isn't a sin on that list.

83
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:10,820
Neither is shame.

84
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,133
Come on, Dad. Time to go.

85
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,886
I was afraid of this parade
because I wanted so badly

86
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,429
to be a part of it.

87
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,501
So today,
I'm marching for that part of me

88
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,337
that was once too afraid to march.

89
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,806
And for all the people
who can't march...

90
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,477
the people living lives like I did.

91
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,693
Today, I march to remember
that I'm not just a me.

92
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm also a we.

93
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:37,156
And we march with pride.

94
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,122
So go fuck yourself, Aquinas.

95
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,749
Hell, yeah!

96
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,361
You OK back there?

97
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:11,041
- Mom, she's up.
- Oh, thank God.

98
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,211
I was sure he was gonna
be in a coma the rest of my life.

99
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,299
How you feeling, Michael?

100
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:20,425
My name is Nomi.

101
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,804
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your mother's been calling you Michael.

102
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,098
What kind of name is Nomi?

103
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,309
Have you ever heard
of anyone named Nomi?

104
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,978
You were Michael
before you came out of me,

105
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,730
and you will be Michael
until they put me in my grave.

106
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:36,400
Mom, come on. She almost died.

107
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,568
Serves you right.

108
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:43,199
You shouldn't be riding on motorcycles.

109
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:47,452
Do you know how many people a year
die on those things?

110
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,621
Where's Amanita?

111
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:51,957
She left.

112
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,544
She wouldn't have left me.

113
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:58,922
This hospital only allows family
into critical care.

114
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,425
She is my family.

115
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:04,345
Please, Michael, this isn't your blog.

116
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:07,056
This is your life.

117
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,352
I think that you should go.

118
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,439
I'm not going anywhere.

119
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:18,192
I'm your mother and I love you.

120
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,112
It may be on my terms, but I do,

121
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:25,824
so I'm not leaving here
until you talk to Dr. Metzger.

122
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:30,246
You still want me to go
after he tells you what he told us...

123
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,542
then I promise I will leave you alone.

124
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,712
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

125
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:41,257
- Didn't say you were.
- Yeah, but...

126
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,052
You didn't believe me either, not about
the woman, the building, the stash,

127
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,637
none of it.
Maybe you'll believe a camera.

128
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:50,433
Building across the street
has got a CTV.

129
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:51,808
I requisitioned the file.

130
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:54,603
This camera's got a perfect view
of the front and back.

131
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,646
Anybody pulled a body out,
we'll see it.

132
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:00,317
OK, this is about the time we pulled over

133
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:02,111
because I thought
I saw that woman, right?

134
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:04,613
Ooh, the blond ghost in her underwear.

135
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,782
I think she visited me last night.

136
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,325
All right, here it is.

137
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,663
What the hell?

138
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,837
This has been erased.

139
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,633
- Somebody erased two hours of this.
- That is weird.

140
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,594
Man, D, something is going on here.

141
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,181
I'll give you there's definitely
a flag on the play.

142
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:37,729
Hey, yo. Check out our man here.

143
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,483
Uh-huh.

144
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,069
He saw the whole thing.

145
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:46,989
This is what a normal,
healthy brain looks like:

146
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:50,117
two distinct,
well-differentiated frontal lobes.

147
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,079
The problem begins here in
the substantia alba of the frontal lobe.

148
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:56,623
These two masses
are growing into one another.

149
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:59,001
You see? There's no separation.

150
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,670
It's often misdiagnosed
as acute encephalitis,

151
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:06,008
but it's a condition called UFLS:
undifferentiated frontal lobe syndrome.

152
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,095
- All acronyms are scary.
- Yeah.

153
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,515
I'll be honest with you, Nomi, is it?

154
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,850
It's not good.

155
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,394
There is a procedure to treat UFLS,

156
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:19,355
but it requires
a very aggressive surgery

157
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,524
where we go in
and try to cut away the growth.

158
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,275
Oh, my God.

159
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:26,403
The surgery is also incredibly expensive.

160
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:29,198
You're going to need to use our insurance.

161
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,868
- Mom.
- These are just the facts, Teagan.

162
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,538
And if I don't have the surgery?

163
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,166
Without the surgery,
the tissue will continue to metastasize.

164
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:43,628
Patients will begin to experience
a deterioration of mental faculties.

165
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:46,006
It's common for them
to experience very intense,

166
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,968
very real hallucinations and synesthesia
that precedes a loss of memory

167
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,928
and a complete occlusion of identity.

168
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,473
He told us if he didn't
operate immediately,

169
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:58,435
- you could be dead within six months.
- Jesus Christ, Mom!

170
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,606
You understand now, Michael?
You're going to need us.

171
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:06,569
- You're going to need your family.
- Don't touch me! You are not my family!

172
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,572
- We should go.
- This is for your own good, Michael.

173
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,948
Don't call me that!

174
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,243
- You're my child. I love you.
- Go!

175
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,495
Just... Just go.

176
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,583
At the premiere with one of the
rising stars in Mexico, Lito Rodriguez,

177
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:09,339
who was recently voted one of the
sexiest men in the world by<i> En Fuego.</i>

178
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:11,467
- Congratulations, Lito.
- Thank you.

179
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,637
And the second time we've seen you
with Ms. Velasquez, isn't it?

180
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,390
What are we to make of this?

181
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,476
Are you guys an item now?

182
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,062
- We're just friends.
- Good friends.

183
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,441
OK. Good friends.
We like hanging out.

184
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,025
He's an amazing dancer.

185
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:32,613
Oh, it must be your Spanish blood, right?

186
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:35,658
- His father taught flamenco.
- Oh, he was from Barcelona, wasn't he?

187
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,785
Bilbao actually.
But he taught in Barcelona.

188
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,705
He was a true artist.

189
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,373
But let's be honest, Christina,

190
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:46,918
when we're out on the dance floor,
nobody's looking at me.

191
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,962
Who could take their eyes off her?

192
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:50,714
He's a keeper.

193
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:55,594
And the movie is
<i>Love Has No Boundaries But Death.</i>

194
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,807
Well, the truth is,
she never even looked at me, not once.

195
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,269
I felt like a stalker,
waiting in the cafeteria

196
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,895
for a chance to ask her out.

197
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,399
I was sure that she didn't like me.

198
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:13,403
But my father taught me
that fortune favors the bold,

199
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:16,031
so I decided to send her flowers
on her birthday.

200
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,158
Lots of flowers.

201
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:21,119
Oh, my God, Kala.

202
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,874
<i>And that got me a chance for a date.</i>

203
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,381
Kala loves the movies,
so we went to see<i> A Match Made by God.</i>

204
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:34,299
Of course, Auntie and Sister came along.

205
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,847
And when Shah Rukh Khan sang
"I See God in You,"

206
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,807
and I saw tears in her eyes,

207
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,687
I hoped more than anything
I've ever wanted...

208
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:51,149
that one day she might
feel that way for me.

209
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,694
Aw!

210
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,244
I told you I had a surprise for you.

211
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:23,635
I like this man.

212
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,304
I really do.

213
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,058
You have no idea
what's going on, right?

214
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:33,478
So you just kinda have to,
like, let go and go with it.

215
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:36,314
And Lito, you... You're so good.

216
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:37,941
I'll tell you the truth.

217
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:41,444
Sometimes when we were shooting,
I was a little bit confused.

218
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,363
Am I this twin here? Am I that twin?

219
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:46,867
No, no, no, but you make it work.
You carry us through.

220
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,372
I mean, there's only like one,
maybe two problems.

221
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:53,832
What?

222
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,963
- She's horrible. Horrible.
- Come on.

223
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:02,883
Don't know what's more fake,
her acting or her tits.

224
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,676
- No, seriously...
- You're terrible.

225
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,887
No, you don't even worry
when the ship goes down,

226
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,390
you know she's going to float away
safely on those things.

227
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:16,897
And afterward, she came up to you
and you told her how great she was.

228
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,107
How do you even do that?

229
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:28,366
You know, you just look them
right in the eye and you lie.

230
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,577
It's what we do. It's called acting.

231
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,079
Speaking of...

232
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:40,796
would you like to come upstairs and...
run some lines with me?

233
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:45,383
I can't. I have an early call tomorrow.

234
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:48,094
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:53,349
I am not used to men telling me no.

236
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,311
It's kind of turning me on.

237
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,063
- I'm sorry.
- Are you sure?

238
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,983
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You sure? You sure?

239
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:02,609
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- You sure?

240
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,236
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah. Good night.

241
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:08,490
Mm...

242
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:56,287
Are you hot? Whoo.
I'm burning up.

243
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,291
It wasn't hot
until Rajan started dancing.

244
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:06,089
- He was good, wasn't he?
- He is awesome.

245
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:11,302
Trust me, if you don't marry him, I will.

246
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:16,016
He's so cute.

247
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:23,398
Whoo.

248
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:34,034
I think locking my keys in my car
was the best thing that's happened to me

249
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:35,869
in a very long time.

250
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:41,708
I'm hungry.

251
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,379
I can make something.

252
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:49,424
No, I have a real craving.

253
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:52,552
For what?

254
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,471
Indian food.

255
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:58,433
Sanyam, sir, the food was unbelievable.

256
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:00,393
- Really, everybody was blown away.
- Yes.

257
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:03,271
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, it was very good.

258
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:06,149
Even though I don't much like
Indian food, but it was good.

259
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,818
I'm more than willing
to help with the wedding if...

260
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,653
Oh, no, no. That won't be necessary.

261
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:14,532
We're bringing in finest chefs
from Europe and Asia. We are good.

262
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:18,161
They say the only thing people
remember about a wedding is the food.

263
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:19,913
- Yes.
- Well, if it's going to be as good

264
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:23,541
as yours was tonight, then the wedding
is definitely going to be unforgettable.

265
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,752
What is unforgettable was your song.

266
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:28,296
Yes, it was the highlight
of the evening.

267
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:29,547
Thank you, Auntie.

268
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:34,218
Did you like it?

269
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:37,346
I did, very much.

270
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:41,643
Sir, is it all right if I say good night?

271
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:44,020
Yes, yes. Go on. Yes.

272
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:46,898
Thank you.

273
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,035
Are you awake?

274
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you awake?

275
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,463
Don't lie.

276
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,923
Are you awake?

277
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:19,181
Are you awake?

278
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:22,475
I am now.

279
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:26,270
Mm...

280
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:29,357
How'd it go?

281
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,110
I don't know.

282
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,282
It was OK.

283
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,326
They liked it?

284
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:42,204
Yeah. You know, it's a premiere.

285
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,164
They have to like it.

286
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:46,415
They liked it.

287
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,752
I told you they would.

288
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:54,799
A lot of people were confused
about which twin survived.

289
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:58,302
Well, that's the whole point.
The uncertainty of our own humanity.

290
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,514
If they don't get that,
they're just fucking idiots.

291
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,810
You make it sound much better
than it is.

292
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:09,564
And what did Ms. Velasquez
have to say about it?

293
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,067
- It was fun.
- Hm.

294
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,529
Let me guess. She was complaining
the whole night about Ana's breasts.

295
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:21,701
But you didn't pick her because of
her insight into genre fiction, did you?

296
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:24,287
No, no.
I have someone else for that.

297
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,081
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

298
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:28,041
Who is that?

299
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:31,836
- He's amazing. He's very sexy.
- Mm?

300
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,924
Super smart. And he does something
that drives me crazy.

301
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,466
- When he's reading...
- Hm-mm.

302
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,302
and he's really into it,

303
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:44,933
he touches his glasses and wrinkles up
his nose at the same time, like this.

304
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:47,977
Look.

305
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:52,690
Every time he does that,
I fall in love with him.

306
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:55,944
Well, he sounds great.

307
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,866
Why not take him... to your premieres?

308
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,913
Come on.

309
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,376
I'm sorry.

310
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,545
You know I'm just jealous.

311
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,507
I just want to be your armpiece.

312
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:25,348
Why be jealous of the arm,
when you already have my heart?

313
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:34,107
What movie is that from?

314
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:38,111
I forgot.

315
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:44,367
- Well, it's... it's quite good.
- Come on.

316
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:54,294
I've been thinking,
it might be time for someone else.

317
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:59,924
Why? Do you think Daniela
knows something?

318
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:05,221
No. I think she just wants
what she cannot have.

319
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:08,350
Mm, damn right.

320
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,147
It's mine.

321
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,070
I had a really nice time.

322
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,447
Me, too.

323
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:31,164
I'm just trying to figure out
if this is it, or you know...

324
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:32,665
if there's more to it.

325
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,462
I'm not looking for a relationship.

326
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:45,387
What are you looking for?

327
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,001
Wolfgang?

328
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,294
Wolfgang?

329
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,297
Hey.

330
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:26,886
Is there someone else?

331
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:29,764
No.

332
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:58,460
<i>Hey, just friend.</i>

333
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,585
Daniela?

334
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:01,712
<i>Mm...</i>

335
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:04,715
Uh-oh.

336
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:09,304
I was sleeping, Daniela.
What are you doing here?

337
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:12,556
I couldn't sleep.

338
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:15,935
<i>I brought company.</i>

339
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:17,270
Oh.

340
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:21,565
- You have to go home.
- <i> Lito.</i>

341
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:25,445
<i>Lito, if you don't let me upstairs,</i>

342
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:27,780
I'm gonna fall asleep
on this doorstep.

343
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,244
<i>Oh! Oh, no!</i>
<i>Are those photographers?</i>

344
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:34,578
<i>Hi!</i>

345
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,791
You know I never say no to bubbles.

346
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,672
OK.

347
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:51,137
Well, our families got on very well,

348
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,432
as far as anyone
can get along with my father.

349
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:57,268
My family can be complicated.

350
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,190
Come on, we both know who's got
the easier job as far as in-laws go.

351
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:16,996
Kala, I sometimes feel your hesitation.

352
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,084
I know there are a lot of things that
might seem like they're separating us.

353
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:27,631
Things like family, religion...
you can sing, I can't.

354
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,259
Not true.

355
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:38,059
It's true we grew up in separate worlds,

356
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:44,148
but the only world I want to live in
is one where we can be together.

357
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,710
- Good night.
- Good night.

358
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,826
Open the door, Lito.

359
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,163
This is not a good idea, Daniela.

360
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,707
I was sleeping.
Please, we'll talk tomorrow.

361
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,420
Come on, Lito.

362
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:49,338
You're acting like a girl.

363
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,560
Mm...

364
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,020
Daniela...

365
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:11,026
Daniela...

366
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,282
We need to talk. OK?

367
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:18,993
Talk.

368
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:23,872
- Later.
- Daniela!

369
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:29,337
I've been thinking, um...
I need some space.

370
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:36,051
Lito... I know where
you're going with this.

371
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:38,804
I'm sorry.

372
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,016
You can break up with me tomorrow.

373
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:44,226
Daniela.

374
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:48,063
- Please...
- Even though I don't know why you would.

375
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:50,232
Everyone says we make
a fantastic couple.

376
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,360
Please...

377
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:56,322
It's true.
But, you know, sadly...

378
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,868
my heart belongs to another.

379
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,997
That's cool.

380
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,249
Daniela! Dani!

381
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:11,086
This is not gonna work.

382
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:14,089
This isn't work.

383
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:16,842
It's just a little harmless sex.

384
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:18,678
No.

385
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:21,013
- Dani...
- So come on.

386
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,140
Dani! Dani!

387
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:25,351
What is the problem, Lito?

388
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:29,980
The problem is, honey...

389
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,901
that you don't have a cock.

390
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:45,663
Hernando, my friend...
good one!

391
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:52,587
Oh, come on, Lito.
Look at her face. She totally knows.

392
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,129
Knows what?

393
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:02,221
Fan-fucking-tastic.

394
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,348
What?

395
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:07,602
Oh, this is perfect.

396
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:11,897
And it's so fucking hot I can't even
stand it, and... We need glasses.

397
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:18,862
I'm confused.

398
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,616
I think perhaps I misjudged
Ms. Velasquez.

399
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,368
This is gonna be perfect.

400
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:25,745
This...

401
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,329
It's gonna be so good for you.

402
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:31,793
I mean, you obviously
need someone you can trust, right?

403
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,920
Someone who can deflect the rumors?

404
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:37,465
And if you know anything
about me or my family,

405
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:42,136
it's that I had to become an expert
at doing such things.

406
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:47,224
Oh...

407
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:50,728
And what do you think
you're gonna get out of this?

408
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:53,230
- Are you kidding?
- No.

409
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,440
This?

410
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:58,778
This is like a dream come true.

411
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,615
Ay...

412
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,306
Time for your medicine.

413
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:12,351
Why is the door locked?

414
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:15,145
- It's hospital policy.
- What?

415
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:18,148
Forget it. Look, I've decided
to check out, so you can, you know,

416
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:21,026
- send my bill to my mom's insurance.
- I can't do that.

417
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:22,611
OK, fine. I'll pay cash.

418
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,823
Dr. Metzger's the only one
who can release you.

419
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:29,159
You can't keep me here
against my will.

420
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:32,580
Oh, I'm sorry, but we can.

421
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:35,875
Dr. Metzger and your family
signed the papers.

422
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,209
What?

423
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:41,923
It's for your safety, Nomi,
as well as the people around you.

424
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:45,760
Take your medicine.

425
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:57,479
I'll have you know I've had a few
psychic experiences myself.

426
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,232
Nocturnal emissions
don't count as psychic phenomenon.

427
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:05,112
Seriously. This one time I was
walking my dog, and this guy goes by,

428
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:08,866
totally innocuous, thin,
scraggly beard, didn't look twice.

429
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,246
But Ditka suddenly goes nuts,
snappin' at him, barking like crazy.

430
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,959
Couple days later, I see a sex offender
warrant out for the guy.

431
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,293
Oh, yeah, yeah, I believe it.

432
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:22,755
You know, there's some things animals
can sense going on that we can't.

433
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:26,467
It should be noted that
Ditka licks his balls all day.

434
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,928
And, if left alone,
will also eat his own shit.

435
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:32,681
OK, boys and girls, settle down.

436
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:38,228
All right everybody, come on! Come on!
Come on guys, let's move it!

437
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:43,734
We have a visitor from our friends
in Washington, so eyes and ears.

438
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:46,528
Agent Stiles.

439
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:48,530
Sorry.

440
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,741
I know a lot of you guys
have seen me lurking about,

441
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:53,953
and it's not because
I'm a butterscotch-bacon donut addict.

442
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:56,455
Thanks very much, guys.

443
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:59,834
The truth is, I head up a federal
task force for Homeland Security,

444
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:04,797
which basically means I'm here
to help you guys catch the bad guys.

445
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,174
This guy is one of the worst.

446
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:10,678
Jonas Maliki.
Goes by a lot of different names,

447
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:12,972
- Jonas Barnett most recently.
- What?

448
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:15,683
- He's wanted for murder...
- I think know that guy.

449
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:18,477
- How?
- I'm not sure.

450
00:38:20,312 --> 00:38:25,275
If he's still here in your city,
we need to know, and we need to know now.

451
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,326
Nomi?

452
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:39,540
- You have to get out of here.
- How-How did you get in here?

453
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,751
If I try to explain it,
you wouldn't believe me.

454
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:44,211
But you will.

455
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:47,422
You... You were at the parade.

456
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:51,134
I was. I came looking for you.

457
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:54,555
Oh, my God.

458
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:57,599
Metzger said I was
gonna start hallucinating.

459
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:01,353
Dr. Metzger's operation
is designed to lobotomize you,

460
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,647
and part of you
already knows this is true.

461
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:06,984
We all know when people are lying to us,
we just don't want to listen.

462
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:11,822
The minute Metzger entered this room,
a voice inside of you told you to run.

463
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:17,036
Right now you need to listen
to that voice, and get out of here.

464
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,625
Uh...

465
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:26,003
Hello?

466
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,591
Amanita, is that you?

467
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:36,722
Oh, my God.

468
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:39,100
I... I'm losing my mind.

469
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:53,215
You got some sack of balls
comin' in here.

470
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:55,843
Hey, he's still my kid.

471
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:58,137
After what he did,
I'd disown the fuck.

472
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,680
Can I talk to you?

473
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:02,224
- You buyin'?
- Yeah, sure.

474
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:04,768
- Round for everybody.
- All right.

475
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,647
Step into my office.

476
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,899
- I ain't drinkin' no traitor beer.
- I'll take his.

477
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:14,611
- What?
- Beer is innocent. It don't take sides.

478
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:17,156
You take my beer and I'll fuck you up.

479
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:21,160
This goddamn thing's been
givin' me grief all day.

480
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,997
Do me a favor, Willy,
go take a shit for me.

481
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,586
Yeah, I get it. You're pissed off
'cause I did my job.

482
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,756
I tried to save that kid's life, Dad.
I'm just... I'm gonna go.

483
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,051
What? Sit down!

484
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:40,054
God, you never had a sense of humor.

485
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:41,513
Come on.

486
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,604
You did what you felt
was the right thing.

487
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:51,398
I'm proud of you for that.

488
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:57,071
But if this punk
ends up killin' somebody,

489
00:41:57,154 --> 00:42:01,116
well then,
you gotta live with that, not me.

490
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,247
But you know that.

491
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,791
You didn't come all the way down here
to talk about that.

492
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:14,088
This isn't easy to say, but I...

493
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:16,715
I think you might be
the only one who's gonna believe me.

494
00:42:19,218 --> 00:42:22,179
Something's going on, Dad,

495
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:24,723
and I think it's got somethin'
to do with Sara Patrell.

496
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,353
Oh, boy.

497
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:36,235
You're actually out of your fuckin' mind.

498
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,321
I'm beginning to wonder.

499
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:44,618
Look, forget about what you did
with that gangbanger.

500
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:48,247
Forget about what these guys
might think of you.

501
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:52,334
If you bring this girl up,
you start talkin' about her again,

502
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:56,088
they'll drag you into psych evaluation
over the next six months.

503
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,215
They'll run you off this force

504
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,927
quicker than you could
scrape dog shit off your shoe.

505
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:06,098
Let her go, Willy. Let her go.

506
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,570
Don't.

507
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:23,365
It's just in your head.
Don't answer it.

508
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,000
Hello?

509
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,377
Oh, my God, it worked!

510
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,005
- <i> I found you finally.</i>
- Amanita?

511
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:40,548
<i>I knew they had you on 18,</i>
<i>so I tried every room.</i>

512
00:43:40,632 --> 00:43:43,302
Oh, my God, where are... Where are you?

513
00:43:43,385 --> 00:43:45,262
Here in the hospital.
They wouldn't let me see you.

514
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:48,473
There's a ton of security on your floor,
but I knew Lola worked here

515
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:51,352
- and she gave me her code.
- Gotta be quick, Neets.

516
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,771
Listen, Nom,
I saw your crazy bitch mother.

517
00:43:54,855 --> 00:43:57,065
<i>I don't know what she thinks</i>
<i>she's doing here, but...</i>

518
00:43:57,149 --> 00:43:59,651
It's not just her.
There's this doctor.

519
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:03,030
Yeah, Metzger.
He signed your papers.

520
00:44:03,113 --> 00:44:05,949
He said that there's
something wrong with my brain.

521
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,910
And Neets,
bad things have been happening.

522
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,245
What things?

523
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:15,583
I've been hearing things
and feeling things and seeing things.

524
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,169
Neets, I'm so scared.

525
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:19,546
It's gonna be OK.
Something is going on.

526
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:21,840
I don't know what it is,
but until we do,

527
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:26,136
I will burn this building down before
I let anyone touch that beautiful brain.

528
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,096
God, I love you.

529
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,433
But what if he's right?

530
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:35,562
Metzger said that I wouldn't
be able to tell the difference

531
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:38,773
between a hallucination and reality,
and Neets,

532
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:42,944
<i>I saw the guy from my dream,</i>
<i>the one that I told you about.</i>

533
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:48,909
<i>He was at the parade and...</i>
<i>and he was here my room.</i>

534
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:52,162
Persian guy? Leather jacket?

535
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:57,459
- Did I tell you that?
- <i> No.</i>

536
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,544
<i>You were taking pictures</i>
<i>before you fainted.</i>

537
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:01,838
I got your phone here.

538
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:05,884
Cameras don't hallucinate,
and that guy is staring right at you.

539
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:15,394
- We gotta go. We gotta go now.
- I'm gonna get you outta here, Nomi.

540
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:16,728
I love you.

541
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:19,273
I love you, too.

542
00:45:37,374 --> 00:45:41,753
Hey, excuse me?
I'm just having some trouble sleeping.

543
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:43,797
What kind of sleeping pills you guys sell?

544
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,840
Somulex.

545
00:45:45,924 --> 00:45:48,009
That's my drug, bro.

546
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:52,722
With a shot of bourbon,
totally knocks me out. Bam!

547
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:55,517
But don't tell anyone
I told you that, 'cause like,

548
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,019
you're not supposed
to take liquor with it.

549
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:00,439
But I totally dig the buzz.

550
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,985
And it gives me major fucked up dreams.

551
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:07,488
Fucked up dreams I got plenty of.

552
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,781
Sure.

553
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,866
We used to do these training courses,

554
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,370
and they taught us
that drugs are like shoes.

555
00:46:15,454 --> 00:46:19,082
Everyone needs them,
but they don't always fit.

556
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,254
- Hm.
- Second aisle to the left.

557
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:27,609
Hello.

558
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,405
My name is Jonas.

559
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:33,114
I know who you are.

560
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:37,077
You know what they told you, and you
know what your senses are telling you.

561
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,205
The question is, Will,
which of the two are you going to trust?

562
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:41,748
How do you know my name?

563
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,084
- She told me.
- Who?

564
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:47,170
Angelica, the woman
that gave birth to you,

565
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:49,089
just before she took her life.

566
00:47:49,172 --> 00:47:51,174
She shot herself.

567
00:47:51,258 --> 00:47:55,178
We all experience many births
and deaths during a life...

568
00:47:56,137 --> 00:48:00,392
but few know what it means
to be reborn a sensate.

569
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:03,520
- A what?
- You have a migraine.

570
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,522
You've had it since you saw her.

571
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,399
It will last for several more days.

572
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:10,611
When mine finally ended,
I cried like a baby,

573
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,195
but that's just the beginning.

574
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:14,155
You will start to feel strange things.

575
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,617
You will feel snow
in the middle of the summer,

576
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:19,661
rain when there isn't
a cloud in the sky.

577
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:23,915
You'll feel anger and joy and pain.

578
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:27,669
Pleasure without any reason.

579
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:32,924
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you see this guy?

580
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,093
I don't have much time, Will.

581
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:37,638
There's a plane leaving in an hour
and I have to be on it.

582
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,013
No, you're not going anywhere.

583
00:48:39,097 --> 00:48:41,558
There is a girl in San Francisco,
Nomi Marks.

584
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:46,354
She needs your help,
just like Sara Patrell needed your help.

585
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,694
I'm still a cop. I can't let you go.

586
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:54,279
I'm not the enemy, Will.

587
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:57,115
Quite a few governments
including this one says you are.

588
00:48:57,198 --> 00:49:00,535
You're about to go for the gun strapped
to your ankle, but by the time you do,

589
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:03,037
the fight will be over.

590
00:49:16,926 --> 00:49:18,720
Not cool, man.
Should I call the cops?

591
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:20,555
I am a cop.

592
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:07,477
- Don't do this, Will.
- What the fuck?!

593
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:09,979
You've spent your life trying
to understand what happened to you.

594
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:12,482
If you don't let me go,
you might never find out.

595
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:16,194
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- No, it's just expanding.

596
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:35,380
Well done.

597
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:39,718
Yes, the connection flows both ways,
which raises the question:

598
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,303
If you're here,
who's driving back there?
