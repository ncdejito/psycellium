1
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,399
I don't get it.

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,442
Why do we have to shoot
the end of the film first?

3
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,026
It's ridiculous.

4
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,735
Some things never change.

5
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,575
I feel a little bit bloated today.

6
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,492
You look fantastic, Lito. Come on.

7
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,749
I... I feel like shit today. Please.

8
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,875
- Can I get some Advil, please?
- Sure.

9
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,004
Are you for real?

10
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,920
Are you for real?

11
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:16,340
- Here it is.
- Did you see?

12
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,966
See what?

13
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,633
- The fuck were you thinkin'?
- Sir?

14
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,509
I just spent the last hour on the phone
getting my ass reamed by the Feds.

15
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,759
- OK, sir, I can...
- You can shut the fuck up.

16
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:38,802
You will know when I'm done speaking
because there will be a pause,

17
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:43,760
followed by the words "I'm sorry, Captain,
this will never happen again."

18
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,428
Pullin' in favors?

19
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:49,888
Tryin' to use your old man's rep
to get around direct orders? For what?

20
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,596
- Was that a pause?
- Jesus flying fuckballs.

21
00:04:56,597 --> 00:05:00,389
Sorry, listen, when I saw Jonas at that
store, I felt like there was a connection.

22
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,640
I thought maybe I could use that
to get some intelligence.

23
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,181
No luck there.

24
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:07,058
Intelligence would have meant
doing what you were told.

25
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,475
None of us have time
for any more of your fuckin' around.

26
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,059
That was the pause.

27
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,851
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

28
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,184
Never happen again.

29
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,769
Now get the fuck outta here.

30
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:36,979
Ah!

31
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,772
- Wolfgang.
- Uncle.

32
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,397
I have a problem.

33
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,149
But the thing about my problems is...

34
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:50,608
that they tend to become
other people's problems.

35
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,192
Sit down, please.

36
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:10,652
There was a robbery a few days ago.

37
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:12,861
Black market diamonds from Mumbai.

38
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:17,779
Stolen from a safe the day before
they were to be picked up by the buyer.

39
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:25,154
I know this because my son
had been casing this place for months.

40
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:29,031
Pickups, deliveries,
when the place was empty.

41
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:34,782
Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,658
And there are few things
as unpleasant for me

43
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,159
as listening to my own son whine.

44
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:49,784
The interesting part is...
the safe was not drilled.

45
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:53,160
No one bored through
to look at the tumblers,

46
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,953
poured liquid nitrogen
or acid inside.

47
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,080
No, no, no, no.

48
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,788
The safe was cracked.

49
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,037
Yeah.

50
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:13,331
More interesting still is...
that the safe was an S&D.

51
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:18,207
The same kind of safe
that fucked your father.

52
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,125
Mm.

53
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,626
It would be an irony
of Shakespearean proportions

54
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:33,167
if his son fucked his own life

55
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:37,586
cracking the safe his father
failed to crack, wouldn't it?

56
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,379
I'm not as stupid as my father.

57
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:56,089
Wolfgang? Your father made mistakes.

58
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,798
Every man does.

59
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,341
You should always remember who you are.

60
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:13,051
I think about that every day.

61
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,518
I don't understand.

62
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:52,517
You speak English?

63
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,684
- Uh... You speak English?
- Oh, yes.

64
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,644
I speak very good English.

65
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:03,853
Where am I?

66
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:08,977
It's so warm, I can feel the heat.

67
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:11,853
Kibera, Nairobi.

68
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:14,437
In Africa?

69
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,730
Africa... Kenya.

70
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,730
Where is this? This is freezing.

71
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,356
London.

72
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,981
London. Ah...

73
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:31,192
<i>Harry Potter.</i> The Queen. Eh?

74
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,358
English tea.

75
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,401
Can I?

76
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,112
I like it.

77
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:15,282
Hey, Van Damme,
give me the fucking bag.

78
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,406
I can't do that.

79
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,200
Give it to me
or we beat the fuck out of you.

80
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,577
I don't want to hurt you.

81
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,788
If your enemy will not be humbled,
destroy him.

82
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,288
Give the bag, bitch!

83
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,000
Van Sham.

84
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:39,299
Spirit of Jean-Claude Korean lady,

85
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,923
I know you have
more important things to do,

86
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:45,551
but for me, nothing is more important.

87
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:08,511
OK, Lito.
So, big scene: boy meets girl.

88
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:12,178
You have started working for her father,
Don Carlos. Right?

89
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,679
Am I beginning to suspect that
he is behind the death squads?

90
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,639
No, definitely not.
You find him charming.

91
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,348
- But I think I sense he is evil, right?
- No, not at all. No.

92
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:25,057
- You are just hot for his daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:29,142
The script is full of so much pain.

94
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,518
I think I should feel it.

95
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,266
- No, not at all. Here.
- Hey...

96
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:38,475
You need fire, you need heat, OK?

97
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,143
- We're going to keep it sexy.
- OK, yeah.

98
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,768
- Can you keep it sexy for me?
- Yeah.

99
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,893
Yes? El CaÃ­do, remember.

100
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:46,936
OK, can we shoot today? Yes?

101
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:49,395
Are we ready? OK. Here we go.

102
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,519
<i>- </i>Nachito! Come on!
- Take position, everyone!

103
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,022
We're ready to shoot! Come on!

104
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:58,105
Boy!

105
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,480
Bah!

106
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,855
Bah-bah-bah! Bah!

107
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,857
And action!

108
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,486
Cut!

109
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:41,029
Lito, what are you doing?

110
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,196
Tears are not hot.

111
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,532
- Tears are not sexy.
- Sorry. My fault.

112
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,948
Um... I'm just feeling
a little emotional today.

113
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,365
I was suddenly struck by her beauty

114
00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:01,909
and the knowledge that...
all beauty is temporary.

115
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,826
Decay and death
haunt every breath we take.

116
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:09,243
Lito, are you kidding me?
Lighten up.

117
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:13,285
"Decay and death"?
This is a movie, for fuck's sake.

118
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,618
OK, people. Come on. Nachito!

119
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,703
We don't have all day! Come on!

120
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,870
Take your positions, everyone!
We're going again! Come on!

121
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:23,496
OK, Lito,
take a breathe or something.

122
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,497
Wait, wait, wait!

123
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,747
- I need makeup, man. Bring me the makeup.
- Makeup!

124
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:35,788
Mehndi represents the outer
and the inner sun of your being.

125
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:38,375
It is the awakening of your inner light.

126
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,999
It strengthens and deepens the bond

127
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,126
between you and the man
who's to be your husband.

128
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,668
- Mom?
- Hm?

129
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,086
How did you feel about Dad at this point?

130
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:59,295
We had met only once
when we were very young...

131
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,879
when his family came to Punjab.

132
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:07,380
Were you nervous? Excited?

133
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:11,004
Did you think Dad
was gonna make you happy?

134
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,547
Things were much different then.

135
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,672
Love marriages were not very common.

136
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:22,757
I think, uh, you are the first
in the family, in fact, to marry for love.

137
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,424
But many things are the same.

138
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:32,009
My family wished the same thing for me
as we wish for you.

139
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,093
And he's a perfect match for you.

140
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,301
You know, my astrologer saw many children.

141
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:46,178
Everything is going to be all right,
my dear.

142
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,845
- Everything's going to be perfect.
- Yes.

143
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:53,847
Aah! Don't move!

144
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,891
Don't move.

145
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:17,143
What is wrong with you?

146
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,518
Never have I seen you
this unfocused before.

147
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:26,310
- You are of two minds.
- At least.

148
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,019
What?

149
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,854
Nothing, teacher.

150
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,687
There are better ways
that I could be spending my time.

151
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:44,314
Whatever is distracting you,
whatever it is you must decide or do,

152
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:50,607
decide it and do it,
and then come back to me.

153
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,859
I'm a fucking mess.
I'm a fucking mess, Hernando.

154
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>The set doctor said you were fine.</i>

155
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,361
Fine? Fine?

156
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,445
No, no, Hernando, I'm not fine.
I have a horrible pain in my stomach.

157
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:16,405
It's... I'm paralyzed. I'm...

158
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,988
It feels like a tumor.

159
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:25,780
You know cancer runs in my family,
Hernando. What if it's cancer?

160
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,740
What is it? What is...

161
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,364
What is the point? What is the point?

162
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,782
My lane isn't going any faster,
you... fuck!

163
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,532
I see you, villain!

164
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:40,867
I see you with your
fucking villain mustache!

165
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,159
- Fuck!
- <i>Calm down, Lito.</i>

166
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,784
- I'm under attack, Hernando!
- <i> OK, take a deep breath, please.</i>

167
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,909
I can't.

168
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,036
I can't breathe! I can't think!

169
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:57,286
I... I can't remember anything!

170
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,162
- Hernando... Hernando? Are you there?
<i>- Yes, yes, yes, I am here.</i>

171
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,371
You know, before, I went to order <i>elotes</i>.
You know I love <i>elotes.</i>

172
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,871
<i>Yes, you love </i>elotes<i>, yes.</i>

173
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:10,788
But when I tried to order them, I couldn't
remember that <i>elotes</i> are called <i>elotes.</i>

174
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,622
<i>Lito, you're going to have an accident.</i>

175
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:17,123
Oh, you did not! Excuse me! I... You...

176
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:20,498
You tacky, cheap weave,
plastic-titted whore!

177
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,666
I see you! I see you!

178
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,375
Please stop screaming.

179
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:26,918
I'm not screaming!

180
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,836
Where am I?

181
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,085
<i>Lito, please, listen to me.</i>

182
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:42,003
I don't know where I am, Hernando.
Hernando?

183
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,920
<i>Are you hearing voices?</i>

184
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,337
No, I'm... I'm seeing things.

185
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,171
<i>Seeing things?</i>

186
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:52,089
There's... There's a crying Korean woman.

187
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,256
I'm not... crying.

188
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:59,214
There's a Korean woman
standing next to me,

189
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:02,841
and she's not crying the same way
that I'm not screaming!

190
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,508
<i>Lito, what happened?</i>

191
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,134
What the fuck?!

192
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:15,302
- Hernando, please save me.
- Where you get your license, man?

193
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:49,767
Fuck! Hey! Fuck!

194
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:07,311
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Janet Marks?

195
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,479
- <i> Yes?</i>
- Hi. This is Officer Will Gorski.

196
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,853
- I'm calling about your daughter Nomi.
- <i> Have you found him?</i>

197
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:16,979
Not yet. The hospital she was admitted to
reported her missing.

198
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,230
I was hoping you might
have some more information.

199
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,021
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

200
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:24,064
<i>This isn't the first time</i>
<i>Michael's had problems with the police.</i>

201
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:27,231
Yeah, I'm seeing
some arrests here for hacking,

202
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,190
misdemeanor electronic intrusion...

203
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,024
<i>Police showing up at our door</i>
<i>at all hours.</i>

204
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:38,524
<i>Michael fell in with bad company,</i>
<i>got infected with all these crazy ideas.</i>

205
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:42,067
<i>I think all this business</i>
<i>with his brain began</i>

206
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,068
<i>with those hormones he started taking.</i>

207
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,818
<i>Most of it is illegal.</i>

208
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:50,485
<i>God only knows</i>
<i>what's really inside that stuff.</i>

209
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:53,737
<i>But, Michael's never been sensible.</i>

210
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,361
- Nomi.
- <i> What?</i>

211
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,487
Not Michael. Her name is Nomi.

212
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:05,072
Hey, hon. Just got a text from Disney.
They're on their way.

213
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,740
You OK?

214
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:14,031
Something happened
when I walked over here, didn't it?

215
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,366
What?

216
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,950
I was looking at the people
and I had this feeling.

217
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:24,534
It was so familiar,
something I've known my entire life.

218
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,701
The feeling of being seen and not seen,

219
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:33,743
of being a part of them
and being apart from them.

220
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:40,411
And then I saw you... the first person
that made all of that go away,

221
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,871
that made me feel I did fit in,
that I belonged.

222
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,998
I saw you and for a moment...

223
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,165
I didn't know who you were.

224
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,249
It feels impossible. What's happening
to me, it feels impossible.

225
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,248
Honey, not so long ago,
the idea of someone like me,

226
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:08,708
someone with my crazy thoughts,
my... desires,

227
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,168
someone with this kind of hair...

228
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,086
would've been completely impossible
in this world.

229
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,710
Just as there was a time in my life

230
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:20,294
when the idea of me falling in love
with someone like you...

231
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,087
Honestly?

232
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:27,047
Even I would have said
it was impossible.

233
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:35,673
And yet, there we are,
in that tiny bathroom at the Lexington,

234
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:39,007
and from the instant my lips
touched these two lips...

235
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,883
I realized one of the most important
lessons of my life:

236
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,385
impossibility is a kiss away from reality.

237
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:04,095
He kissed me.

238
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:09,553
The first time I kissed your father,
oh, dear!

239
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,512
Don't know whether he would
want me to tell you all this.

240
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:14,721
Of course,
because I'm back here cooking,

241
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:17,639
I cannot hear a word you are saying,
my dearest one.

242
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:22,097
The truth is,
for the longest time,

243
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:26,557
I thought kissing is as eating a kebab,
because whenever I would kiss,

244
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,099
all I would taste
was spices and garlic on his lips.

245
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,724
I'm sure that
whatever you are laughing at

246
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,766
would not be at the expense of a man

247
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:38,100
who would slave for hours making...
shahi tukda.

248
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:41,060
Ooh!

249
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:42,685
Oh, my God.

250
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:45,354
Kala, you are beautiful.

251
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,729
Thanks, Dad.

252
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:50,937
May I?

253
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,354
It's for you.

254
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,272
Mm...

255
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,814
Dad, could you teach Rajan how to make it?

256
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,107
No.

257
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:15,399
A minute ago,
this tasted like a normal coffee.

258
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,233
Now it tastes like a sugary dessert.

259
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,401
That doesn't sound like a bad thing.

260
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:27,193
What if Dr. Metzger's right and there is
something wrong with my brain?

261
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:30,446
Well, there are two possibilities.

262
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,320
Possibility one: He's telling the truth.

263
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:38,945
There is something wrong with your brain.

264
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:43,572
And it's causing hallucinations
and you're gonna die.

265
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,571
I'm not digging that one.
What's possibility two?

266
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,989
That he's lying.

267
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,198
That what he says is happening to you
isn't what's happening.

268
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,032
And if that's the case,
there has to be a reason why he's lying,

269
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,741
and we need to find out
what that reason is.

270
00:24:57,742 --> 00:25:01,326
Don't worry, hon,
we are going to figure this out.

271
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,622
Well done, Van Damme.

272
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,040
Come.

273
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,083
What is going on here?

274
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,333
You passed my test.

275
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,583
Why?

276
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,792
I had to know how far you would go.

277
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:54,835
If you're willing to risk your life for...

278
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:01,337
a pair of coconuts,
then you're the man I need.

279
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,716
I'll be in touch, Van Damme.

280
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:45,136
"Steiner's furious!"

281
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:49,220
"Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

282
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:55,138
"There are few things as unpleasant for me
as listening to my own son whine."

283
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:59,222
"Oh, Daddy!

284
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:05,057
Daddy, somebody stole my diamonds.
I want my..."

285
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,015
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, hey. New shirt.

286
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:10,101
Don't ever use that word, understand?

287
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,558
Sergei's not stupid. He's watching us.

288
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,143
- Sergei doesn't know shit.
- Yeah.

289
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:18,267
If he did, we'd be dead.

290
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:23,851
He was just fucking with you,
trying to see if you knew anything.

291
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:27,687
Probably had box men coming in all day,
giving them the same routine.

292
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:32,437
He's just shaking the trees.

293
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:36,146
Keep quiet. Stick to the plan.

294
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:38,814
Got it.

295
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:43,771
"Steiner's furious."

296
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,024
Gotta piss.

297
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:07,778
Who's there?

298
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,112
Is there a woman in here?

299
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:16,237
What do you mean is there
a woman in here. This is my bathroom.

300
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:22,280
Your bathroom? Lady,
I think you may be even drunker than I am.

301
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:26,155
I'm not drunk,
though obviously you are!

302
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:36,366
What are you talking about?

303
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:40,284
I know that voice...

304
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,493
Where are you?

305
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:50,451
You are the singing man in my dream.

306
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,118
I can't see you.

307
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:55,662
Wolfgang?

308
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,329
What the hell language is that?

309
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:09,372
Kala? Are you all right?
I heard you talking to someone.

310
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:15,083
Oh, just... to myself.

311
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:16,957
Oh.

312
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:20,875
Well, if you ever need someone
to talk to about things...

313
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,373
Things?

314
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,291
Things that happen
on a girl's wedding night.

315
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,334
Auntie, it's OK.

316
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,209
We have the Internet.

317
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,710
Oh!

318
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,710
I knew that thing
was good for something.

319
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,253
Mm.

320
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,463
<i>Am I making my mind up as it happens?</i>

321
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:48,337
- Or do I already know?
- You tell me, baby. You're the guy.

322
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:51,297
Just make it real.
I want your guts on this one, yes?

323
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:53,504
I think I should have a line
before I reach Don Carlos.

324
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,047
- Sure. Whatever. Put it in. Yes.
- OK.

325
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,089
So we're gonna rehearse
with the squibs, right?

326
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,131
Fuck, no! I want chaos, confusion.

327
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,882
I want blanks firing, squibs exploding.

328
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:07,842
Total mayhem surrounding the meaningless
destruction of precious art.

329
00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:10,799
That's... That's the message of this film.

330
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,385
And without the grit of reality,
nobody's going to believe it.

331
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:16,300
- OK? Your guts?
- OK.

332
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:19,134
Yes! OK, are we ready for this? Nachito!

333
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:21,553
- Bring it on, please. Come on, everybody.
- Bah! Bah!

334
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,218
You won't believe it till you see it
with your own eyes. She's double-jointed.

335
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:29,845
Blows the candles out on a cupcake
stuck in her own ass.

336
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:32,179
Yeah, she's a real artist.

337
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,430
Uh...

338
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,889
I can't. I got paperwork.

339
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,973
Oh, you're goin'. It's Miller's 40th.

340
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:40,430
You have to pay your respects.

341
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:44,015
So, sign the fucking card,<i> pendejo.</i>

342
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,058
Go on and put a twenty in there.

343
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,642
- Holy shit.
- What?

344
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,101
I requested an up-rez
of your photo from last night.

345
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,518
- The kid?
- Yeah, check it out.

346
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,977
Hey, check existing contacts.

347
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,101
Checking.

348
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,977
Boom. Name and last known.

349
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:09,520
Let's go.

350
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:13,103
Oh, I thought you had paperwork to do.

351
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,021
No? No? All right.

352
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:19,688
- Here they are.
- Oh.

353
00:31:21,064 --> 00:31:22,606
- Mm...
- Hey.

354
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,480
Sorry it took so long.
I just wanted to be sure.

355
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:27,564
There were cops?

356
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,481
There's one staked out front
of your place.

357
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:32,066
Every couple of hours, an unmarked car
rolls through the alley.

358
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,276
Shit.

359
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,942
Were you able to get hold of Isabella?

360
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,735
She said no problem
using her back entrance.

361
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,692
Thank you guys so much.
I know how much trouble this is.

362
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,442
It's not a problem, Nomi.

363
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:49,778
After what you did for Lola and me?
You're family.

364
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:53,987
Clete Tamark. Couple convictions.

365
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:56,444
Vandalism, disorderly conduct, MIP.

366
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:59,487
He's running with
the New Maniac Mafia up in Englewood.

367
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,447
What happened to the Old Maniac Mafia?
I miss them.

368
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,612
He's just a kid, too.

369
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:09,907
They're all kids, Will. They're all kids.

370
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:22,701
Art is like religion.

371
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:25,867
For the believers, it's everything.

372
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,410
For anyone else...

373
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,078
it's just a pile of stinking bullshit.

374
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:47,872
I know you.

375
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,500
Do I know you?

376
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,167
This is not who you are.

377
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:14,335
Clete! Cops!

378
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,419
Kill him!

379
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:19,587
Oh, shit!

380
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,752
Shit! Fuck!

381
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:25,838
Hey! Stop!

382
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,713
Boy, you better stop!

383
00:33:42,382 --> 00:33:43,883
I fuckin' hate this shit!

384
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:08,305
Ah!

385
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,513
- Fuck!
- Get up, get up! Go, go, go!

386
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,722
- Kick me. Kick me.
- What?

387
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,099
Kick me.

388
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,062
Y'all smell pork?

389
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,899
You in the wrong 'hood, po-po.

390
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,066
- Get yo' bacon-smellin' ass on.
- You motherfuckers on a coffee break?

391
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,733
Yeah, with yo' mama.

392
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,484
All right.

393
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:26,486
What's wrong with this nig...?
Bye-bye!

394
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,694
OK, we're gonna have some fun.

395
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:34,861
- Fucking cut!
- How was it?

396
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:38,237
I've got a hard-on
that's gonna last all week!

397
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:42,404
Oh, so natural, so real!

398
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:45,238
- Bra-vo! Bravo!
- Yes, yes, yes!

399
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,780
Yes!

400
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:47,863
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

401
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,030
I apologize. I'm sorry, man.

402
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,323
- That's in the movie.
- Yeah?

403
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,405
- That's in the movie, Lito!
- It's in the movie?

404
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,782
- Yes! Come on!
- Thank you.

405
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:21,299
Where am I? Where is this?

406
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,757
Nairobi.

407
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,341
Where are you?

408
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:28,633
Seoul.

409
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:35,551
- You speak Korean?
- Do you speak Swahili?

410
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,843
Then how are we understanding each other?

411
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:41,262
I don't know.

412
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,386
You are the spirit of Jean-Claude.

413
00:37:47,387 --> 00:37:50,803
I felt your spirit in me.

414
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,429
You are a very good fighter.

415
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,846
You don't know anything about me.

416
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:59,306
I don't know how,
but I know your name is Sun.

417
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:04,557
- You have a difficult decision to make.
- Stop. This cannot be real.

418
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,722
What is real is I might have died
if it wasn't for you.

419
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,306
I don't understand this.

420
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:13,101
So if you do not mind,
I prefer to assume you're a hallucination.

421
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:15,683
I take no offense.

422
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:19,475
Since that is resolved,
I would like to continue my walk.

423
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:21,309
Please.

424
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,353
- Alone.
- Of course.

425
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:40,646
- You're still here.
- I'm sorry.

426
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:43,147
I don't know how I came here
or how I go back.

427
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:46,647
Perhaps there is something in me
that calls or something in you that calls.

428
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:48,773
I'm not calling you or anyone else.

429
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,482
Perhaps that is the problem.

430
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,233
Are you in trouble?

431
00:38:56,317 --> 00:39:00,651
No. But tomorrow I might be.

432
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:19,696
I know this choice.

433
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,655
It's like having two different lives.

434
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,822
One will be very dangerous for me.

435
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:30,865
The other, very bad for my mother.

436
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:39,699
My question is, am I the person
who wants to see my brother punished,

437
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,284
who wants to watch the business
my father built be destroyed?

438
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,034
Or am I the person
who wants to save them,

439
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:51,159
who will go to prison for them,

440
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,578
even though they have been cruel to me
for my entire life?

441
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,911
You are afraid.

442
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,038
I feel it for my mother every day.

443
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:08,622
I promised I would take care of her.

444
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:12,207
Everything will be all right...

445
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:15,290
I must keep that promise.

446
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:19,249
I must keep it, no matter what.

447
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:25,500
I promised my mother
I would protect my family.

448
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:29,750
It was the last thing I said to her
before she died.

449
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:33,460
- If I break it...
- Then your last words become a lie.

450
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:42,337
Once, when I was eight...

451
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:47,089
my father's enemies came to our house.

452
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:51,380
They had big machetes, like this.

453
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:54,380
My mother had a knife, like this.

454
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:57,506
<i>They wanted revenge</i>
<i>for what my father's tribe had done.</i>

455
00:40:57,507 --> 00:40:59,798
<i>They wanted me.</i>

456
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:03,091
<i>My father was gone. She was alone.</i>

457
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:09,925
<i>But... she put me behind her,</i>
<i>and she faced these men.</i>

458
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:12,508
<i>They knew they could kill her.</i>

459
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:16,469
<i>But they also looked her</i>
<i>in the eyes and knew</i>

460
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,051
<i>she would take</i>
<i>at least one of them with her.</i>

461
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:21,886
And they left.

462
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,678
Because none of them
wanted to be that one.

463
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:34,429
Who can say if it is
we who make the choice,

464
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,556
or the choice that makes us?

465
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,934
...the ceremony.
The last thing we would...

466
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,769
The color's
really looking nice on her.

467
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,727
- Think it shows the right...
- Where did you have it made?

468
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:09,144
- The same tailor we normally use?
- I had no idea how heavy it all would be.

469
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,853
I hope I don't collapse
in the middle of the circle.

470
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,356
Priya!

471
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,357
Priya, I don't want to
pressure anyone, but...

472
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,150
- Sanyam, please!
- All right, all right. Take your time.

473
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,893
I take the first of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be...

474
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:45,518
that we may cherish each other
and promise that we will grow together...

475
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,354
<i>in mental and spiritual strength.</i>

476
00:45:51,604 --> 00:45:54,856
I take the fourth
of the seven steps with you...

477
00:45:56,688 --> 00:46:01,397
I take the fifth of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be,

478
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:04,815
and promise love and obedience
in all things.

479
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,359
I take the sixth of the seven steps
with you, my wife-to-be...

480
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:23,651
with the promise of
everlasting companionship.

481
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:34,569
We shall share love.

482
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,197
Share the same tastes.

483
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,531
Share the same food.

484
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:04,284
The final vow, the final step,
is yours, my love.

485
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:34,874
Let us make a vow together
to share our strengths.

486
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,918
We shall be of one mind.

487
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:06,462
We shall observe these vows together.

488
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:16,590
Come thou, as I take the last
of seven steps with you and...

489
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:26,550
What the fuck are you doing?

490
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:29,967
You're not in love with him.

491
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:35,341
Kala? Kala?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
