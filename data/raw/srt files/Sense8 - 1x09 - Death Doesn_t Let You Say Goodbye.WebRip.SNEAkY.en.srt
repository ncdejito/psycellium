00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,956
I remember the first time
you sang with me.

3
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:24,835
I don't know why we sing
such terrible things of children.

4
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,799
Maybe we try to warn them
of what's to come.

5
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,178
You're not one of
the Hidden People, are you?

6
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,891
If you mean an elf, no.

7
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,111
You're like me.

8
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,821
Sensate.

9
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,490
Do you live here, in Iceland?

10
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,241
I do.

11
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:58,744
Sit down.

12
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,802
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

13
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:19,682
I needed you to believe me.

14
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,812
I needed you to believe...
that you weren't safe here,

15
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,271
because you're not.

16
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:32,277
There were two worlds.

17
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:37,491
I was living in...
in two separate worlds.

18
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,371
Then...

19
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:48,752
And then somehow they crashed...
into one another.

20
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,550
And now everything is dead.

21
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:00,763
Another.

22
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,062
So are we celebrating or mourning?

23
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,697
I'm celebrating.

24
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:20,492
I know how you feel.

25
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:25,413
You do?

26
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,212
I mean... I don't know
what it's like to be famous, but...

27
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,506
I know what it's like living two lives.

28
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,804
Do you know who I am?

29
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,557
You're an actor, right?

30
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,645
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

31
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:52,149
I saw you in that telenovela
where you had an evil twin

32
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,651
that was trying
to take over your life, right?

33
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,030
The Mirror Has No Heart.

34
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:00,490
That's it.

35
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:03,660
You were good in it and... bad.

36
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,582
But... that's what this is about,
isn't it?

37
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,794
The movie said something true
about all of us,

38
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:16,548
that we all have this... other nature,
this... secret self

39
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:21,262
that is capable of really beautiful
and really terrible things.

40
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,769
I, too, have a secret self.

41
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,106
And right now...

42
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:35,901
it really wants to take you
to that bathroom over there

43
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:41,448
and do some...
beautiful and terrible things to you.

44
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,911
What are you doing?

45
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:51,083
How can you possibly
think that I could be like that?

46
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm not a faggot.

47
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:06,932
The Biologic Preservation Organization
funds projects like the DNA census

48
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:10,894
in order to track and hunt down
any potential sensate.

49
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,480
Do you work for them?

50
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:17,193
I try to save the ones I can
before they're discovered.

51
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:19,987
Your mother brought you in

52
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,824
to see if you have the genes
for the same disease that was killing her.

53
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:28,620
And fortunately, I saw the report on you
before anyone else did.

54
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:33,125
You told a child she was hexed.

55
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:40,841
You made me believe that...
I caused my mother's death.

56
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:44,303
I'm sorry if I caused you
unnecessary pain.

57
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:50,184
Because of you, I believed that what
happened in the mountains was my fault.

58
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,313
My intention was to protect you.

59
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,030
You have children?

60
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,078
- Never wanted them.
- Why?

61
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,332
Afraid they would be like me.

62
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:18,754
Afraid they would be hunted...
that I would have to feel them die.

63
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:18,814
Don't look at him.

64
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:21,858
That's how he got me.

65
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,153
He knows you're here.

66
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,654
Run!

67
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,161
Look at me! Look at me!

68
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,504
Shit.

69
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:10,533
Hello, Will.

70
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,703
You knew what was happening.

71
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:20,459
Why didn't you help me?

72
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,295
I took terrible chances to protect you.

73
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,755
I felt your pain.

74
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,091
I lived it.

75
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,470
I called the rescue authorities.

76
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,056
If I hadn't gotten involved,
you'd be dead.

77
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,105
That's what I wanted.

78
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,817
To be dead.

79
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,572
To be with them.

80
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,073
I know.

81
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:58,539
When we lost one of our cluster,
I thought the pain would destroy me.

82
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,501
But life holds onto you.

83
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:08,424
And sometimes, it finds a way
to push back into your heart.

84
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:13,011
And if you're lucky...
it gives us another chance.

85
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,765
And what if you
don't want another chance?

86
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:20,894
If you didn't,
you wouldn't have come looking for me.

87
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,022
I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.

88
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,857
Where are you?

89
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,484
I don't know.

90
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,324
Not the poshest place I've been...

91
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,826
but not the worst either.

92
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:40,997
- What are they doing to you?
- Watching, measuring.

93
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,042
Those cameras are recording this,

94
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,753
so if I want to say anything
I don't want them to hear...

95
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:49,131
I have to come to you.

96
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:53,552
If you visit,
you speak as a voice in my head.

97
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:57,306
But if I speak without visiting,
it looks like I'm talking to myself.

98
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,015
I figured that out the hard way.

99
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,327
We have to get you outta there.

100
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,605
I've been unconscious for so long,
I could be anywhere.

101
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:08,024
Don't worry about me.

102
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,653
Right now, I have value to them.

103
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:11,945
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,573
This is all my fault.

105
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,034
Angelica didn't believe in fault.

106
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:22,914
She said it was the present
understood by people looking backward.

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,751
We have to look forward.

108
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,005
If we don't, we won't survive.

109
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,722
And now that you know the truth...
it's time for me to go.

110
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,101
- Why?
- Because you came back.

111
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:47,481
And if they find you,
you're going to lead them straight to me.

112
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,156
No, I won't.

113
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,367
Accidents happen.

114
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,453
You know that more than most.

115
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:03,497
But I'll be careful.

116
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,124
I've seen it happen so many times.

117
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,085
One simple slip, then a hospital,

118
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:13,089
and before you even understand
the consequences, you will be arrested.

119
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,217
I won't tell anyone about you.

120
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,302
You won't have a choice.

121
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,392
They have ways...
techniques of tracing the psycellium.

122
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:25,268
Psycellium?

123
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:28,855
It's kind of a psychic nervous system.

124
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,190
It connects us...

125
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:36,112
allows you to be here with me...
or your cluster.

126
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,742
If you listen closely to it,
you can hear it vibrating.

127
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,159
Here.

128
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,914
Listen with this, not with the mind.

129
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,378
Follow where the feeling takes you.

130
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,715
I know all about BPO.

131
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:57,718
I know how they're funded,
how they spend their money...

132
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,304
- This is just a start.
- You work fast.

133
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,266
I will find you.

134
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,184
There are more important things than me.

135
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,982
Riley.

136
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,235
The girl from Iceland.

137
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,489
- Who are you talking to?
- Jonas.

138
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,658
- You found him?
- He found me.

139
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:25,412
Is she with someone?

140
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:27,955
Are you alone?

141
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,669
Her name is Yrsa.

142
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,089
She's like us.

143
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,174
You like this girl, don't you?

144
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:44,055
You feel very connected to this boy.

145
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,932
I remember
what it was like to first share

146
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,602
someone's every thought and emotion.

147
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,397
This is very dangerous.

148
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:55,942
I was in love with Angelica
from the moment our eyes touched.

149
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:01,281
Love inside a cluster is pathological.

150
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,949
Are you all right?

151
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,702
Sometimes.

152
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:09,998
Angelica believed a sensate
experiences love in its purest form.

153
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,417
Are you all right?

154
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,212
Sometimes.

155
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,757
Ask when he was born.

156
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,009
What?

157
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,845
His first birth, ask him.

158
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,848
She wants to know
when your birthday is.

159
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,474
August 8th.

160
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:32,562
What?

161
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:34,898
That's my birthday.

162
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,860
A cluster is always born
on the same day?

163
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:41,070
However far across the world
a cluster is scattered,

164
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,573
the first breath they take,
they take as one.

165
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:47,494
Love inside a cluster
is the worst kind of narcissism.

166
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:49,954
What?

167
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,041
I have to go.

168
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,462
- I hope you can help Jonas.
- Jonas?

169
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,047
Is that Jonas Maliki?

170
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:03,051
- What's Jonas' last name?
- Maliki.

171
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,555
Get away from there!

172
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:09,599
She's gone.

173
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,271
Don't let her stay in Iceland.

174
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:18,859
A lot of genetic research
funded by BPO is done there.

175
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:20,485
They have a research facility.

176
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,446
Many of us have gone there
and never come out.

177
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,366
You keep using "us" and "them."
Who are we?

178
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:30,078
Who we are is less relevant
than what we are,

179
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,539
and what we are is different from them.

180
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:34,583
I know who birthed you.

181
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,543
Angelica Turing.

182
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,881
Don't you ever be in touch
with that bastard again.

183
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:42,966
Why?

184
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,845
He and that bitch were collaborators.

185
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:50,139
They hunted our kind for BPO.

186
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:52,225
They worked with Whispers.

187
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:57,105
They would give birth to clusters
and use them to find others.

188
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,107
But he tried to help us.

189
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,693
And now you trust him.

190
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,656
If your boy is connected to Jonas,

191
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,492
it won't be long
till Whispers will find you.

192
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,580
You're on your own.

193
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,043
My child.

194
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,297
Who now is your father,
if it is not me?

195
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,090
What are you doing here?

196
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,760
You and this dummkopf
are like my own boys.

197
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,429
We are family.

198
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,389
How is he?

199
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,811
The doctor said he should be dead.

200
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,021
Good man.

201
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,524
Never listen to doctors.
All they know is death.

202
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,151
Life is a mystery to them.

203
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,905
But we understand life, don't we?

204
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,991
Life is simple.

205
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,617
Life is just five things:

206
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:57,540
eating, drinking, shitting, fucking,
and fighting for more, right?

207
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,505
When we were boys,
your father would say that to me,

208
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:07,634
and then he would punch me
as hard as he could.

209
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:13,807
After he was killed,
I realized this was bullshit.

210
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:19,646
At that moment,
all I wanted from life was one thing.

211
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:22,273
Not five, no, no, just one.

212
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,901
Revenge.

213
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:30,448
I wanted the man who killed him.

214
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:35,745
And for that one thing...
I would have given all the rest.

215
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,713
My blood is in your veins, Wolfgang.

216
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,757
I'm sympathetic.

217
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,472
But please, tell me you are smart enough
to know that this was a mistake.

218
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:57,308
Tell me that you understand
this can go no further.

219
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,238
I love you, Wolfgang.

220
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:15,911
But please... don't make me
choose between you and my son.

221
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,754
So the assassins came out of nowhere?

222
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:27,630
Yes.

223
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,883
And you did not see any of their faces?

224
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,509
She told you that.

225
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,512
We're just trying
to get the facts straight, sir.

226
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:37,223
While you're harassing my fiancée,
those killers are still out there.

227
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,225
Miss Dandekar is our best witness.

228
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,352
So you said you and Mr. Rasal
were talking?

229
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:42,687
What did he want to talk about?

230
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:46,108
A personal matter.

231
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,901
Did you discuss religion?

232
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,987
Did you know
that Mr. Rasal had sponsored a bill

233
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,364
that would make
certain religious practices illegal?

234
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:56,701
Everyone knew how my father
felt about religion.

235
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:59,370
Several witnesses testified
that they've seen you

236
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:02,415
- pledging your weight in bananas?
- Is that true?

237
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:05,127
Yes. Yes, it is.

238
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,463
Did you know that act would be illegal
if Mr. Rasal's bill had passed?

239
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:09,965
No.

240
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,216
Do you know a man
who calls himself Guru Yash?

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,593
OK, that's enough.

242
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,762
All these questions
are completely inappropriate.

243
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:17,305
They are simple questions, sir.

244
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:20,016
If you want to continue
asking simple questions to my fiancée,

245
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,144
you will do so
in the presence of my lawyer.

246
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:23,895
Goodbye, detectives.

247
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,483
Sir.

248
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,131
Are you all right?

249
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,657
Do they think
I had something to do with this?

250
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,035
Kala, my father had many enemies.

251
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,789
He frequently talked to the press
about corruption in the police force.

252
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:49,629
- Do you think I had...
- My father had no business being there.

253
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,548
He had so many death threats,
that going to the temple

254
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,050
was just asking for trouble.

255
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:56,636
You did nothing wrong, Kala.

256
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:17,406
There's a line in your film,
The Passion of the Sinner,

257
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,534
that always makes me think of this museum.

258
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,411
"My heart is not a clock."

259
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:25,456
Yeah.

260
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,918
My character was always late.

261
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:33,089
Beautiful line...
made sublime by your performance.

262
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:37,385
An apology... that is also an anthem.

263
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:44,392
Look... love is not something we wind up,

264
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:46,686
something we set or control.

265
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,356
Love... is just like art.

266
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:52,567
Ah...

267
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,486
A force that comes
into our lives without any...

268
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,823
rules, expectations or limitations, and...

269
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:07,123
and every time I hear that line,
I am reminded that... love, like art...

270
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,254
must always be free.

271
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:05,473
You're Lito.

272
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:10,728
You're Nomi.

273
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:15,733
This really isn't a good time for me.

274
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,946
It's not really a good time for me either.

275
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:22,031
Why are you here then?

276
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't know.

277
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,747
I was almost killed.

278
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,709
I didn't know where to go,
so I went home.

279
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:37,046
I was worried about Amanita...

280
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,020
and missing the life that we used to have,

281
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,677
and I was wondering
if I was ever gonna get it back.

282
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:49,976
And the next thing I knew,
I was here.

283
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,646
What is this place?

284
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,815
It's the Diego Rivera Museum.

285
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:00,695
The painter?

286
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,238
Yeah.

287
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:06,242
He was married to Frida Kahlo, right?

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,370
Yes.

289
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:14,250
The day she died, he said,
was the worst day of his life...

290
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:18,713
because he realized too late
that the best thing about his life...

291
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:21,132
was his love for her.

292
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,266
You have a boyfriend?

293
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:35,897
Not anymore.

294
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,985
What happened?

295
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:44,822
I got scared.

296
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:50,870
I play heroes all the time,
but in real life, I'm a coward.

297
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,421
Attention. 773?

298
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:04,633
You have a visitor.

299
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:34,872
Thank you.

300
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,052
I have not slept...
since you came here.

301
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,013
I've never slept so well.

302
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:55,059
- I am not a good person.
- Father, you owe me nothing.

303
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,145
I am not a good person...

304
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:05,611
but when your mother was alive...
I was a better person.

305
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,239
She made me better.

306
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:15,746
When she died...
I thought that part of me died with her.

307
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,251
But it didn't.

308
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,754
It is right here.

309
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:32,054
My company, my wealth,

310
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:34,182
even my reputation...

311
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,479
is meaningless without my daughter.

312
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,653
I am going to tell the truth.

313
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:56,204
Hernando brought me here
on our first date.

314
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:01,209
He said this is the only place
in Mexico City

315
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:05,796
where you can really experience...
Diego Rivera.

316
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,135
These are studies done for a painting

317
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:14,305
that was originally commissioned
by John D. Rockefeller

318
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:16,391
for his new center in New York.

319
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:22,522
Diego changed the original design
and added Lenin, united with workers.

320
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,233
Rockefeller told him to repaint it.

321
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:28,903
Diego refused...
so Rockefeller had it destroyed.

322
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:35,076
Years later,
Diego repainted it here in Mexico...

323
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:39,163
where he thought
the painting would live free.

324
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:43,125
- But...
- Sadly, the actual painting

325
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,336
has been reduced to nothing
but a whore pimped out

326
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,338
by the Bank of Mexico and the Palacio.

327
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:50,132
It is... controlled by censors

328
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:53,428
who treat it exactly
like Rockefeller treated it.

329
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:57,973
Diego would be ashamed of it.

330
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:02,604
Nothing about it is free.

331
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:06,190
All afternoon, he was telling me stories
about the art in here.

332
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:11,571
Hernando can talk about football,
about wrestling,

333
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,115
about paintings,
with such a passionate love.

334
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:17,452
"You fuck with art," he says,
"you'll get fucked by art."

335
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,039
You see that sketch?
That one?

336
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,462
That's Syphilis.

337
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,880
Mm.

338
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:32,091
He painted it over the head
of Rockefeller's father...

339
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:34,051
...drinking with a dance hall girl.

340
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,805
That's why I love it here.

341
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,016
Here...

342
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:45,146
you can feel
the wild and reckless heart...

343
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:49,150
...of a Mexican artist...

344
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,528
still beating.

345
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,745
I was here listening to him for hours,
and... and I couldn't take it anymore.

346
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:14,383
Our first kiss was over there...
in the bathroom.

347
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:21,349
It was for me a religious experience.

348
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:28,814
I went to my knees.

349
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,947
And took him into my mouth like...

350
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:41,118
I was taking Holy Communion.

351
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:52,380
That kind of kiss... changes you.

352
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:57,343
I told Hernando from the beginning, I...

353
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:01,096
I told him how it had to be.

354
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:03,474
What went wrong?

355
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,268
I did.

356
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:12,233
I'm afraid I will lose everything...
that I've worked for.

357
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,365
I know how that feels.

358
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:25,120
But at a certain point, I realized
there's a huge difference between

359
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:28,082
what we work for and what we live for.

360
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:35,464
My whole life,
all I wanted to be was an actor.

361
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:40,595
But you can't be an actor
and get the parts I want... and be gay.

362
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,684
I love dolls.

363
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,773
My father could never forgive me for that.

364
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,361
When I was eight years old,
my father made me join a swim club.

365
00:30:57,445 --> 00:31:00,322
He'd been on the same club and...

366
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:03,909
he said that the things
that he learned in that locker room

367
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,746
were the things that made him
the man that he is today.

368
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,792
I hated that locker room.

369
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,462
At that age,
I was really uncomfortable with my body.

370
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:18,466
I didn't like to be naked,
especially in front of other boys.

371
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:22,678
But you had to take a shower
before you could go in the pool,

372
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,889
so I would do it,
but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.

373
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:30,227
And the boys would tease me,
but I would try to hurry and...

374
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:32,980
ignore them, and it...
it worked for a while.

375
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:36,317
And then one day it didn't.

376
00:31:39,903 --> 00:31:41,363
I don't know how it started,

377
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:46,828
but I remember having this feeling
that something bad was going to happen.

378
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,370
Hey, faggot!

379
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,682
Why do you shower with your clothes on?

380
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,500
Because he ain't got a dick.

381
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,628
I made the mistake
of standing up for myself.

382
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:59,047
You got wood, faggot?

383
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:01,091
Let's strip him!

384
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,678
No, no, no, no!

385
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:07,973
The hot water came from
the same boiler that heated the radiator.

386
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:17,358
I still have scars on my stomach
from the second-degree burns.

387
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:25,032
Stop it!

388
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:30,872
Fucking monsters.

389
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:38,462
I'm sorry.

390
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:47,221
That locker room might have
made my father the man that he is,

391
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:51,225
but it also made me the woman that I am.

392
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:55,688
After that, I quit the swim club.

393
00:32:56,397 --> 00:33:00,025
I quit trying to fit in,
trying to be one of them.

394
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,985
I knew I never would be.

395
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:06,532
But more importantly,
I didn't want to be.

396
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:08,659
Their violence...

397
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:15,290
was petty and ignorant, but ultimately,
it was true to who they were.

398
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:19,545
The real violence...

399
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:24,258
the violence that
I realized was unforgivable...

400
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:28,220
is the violence that we do to ourselves,

401
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,056
when we're too afraid
to be who we really are.

402
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,371
There you are.

403
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:56,540
I needed a chai.

404
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,250
I made one for you, too.

405
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:01,587
Thank you.

406
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,466
What?

407
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:08,928
You've been through so much,
I almost hate to ask...

408
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:10,053
What?

409
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:12,807
It's Mother.
She says she needs to see you.

410
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,642
Oh.

411
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,019
OK. Of course.

412
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,618
Come here.

413
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,378
Rajan says you pray often.

414
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:45,172
I do.

415
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:46,882
Sometimes.

416
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,847
I was born in Bombay.

417
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:56,767
Every Tuesday, I used to go
to the Shree Siddhivinayak temple.

418
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,690
But when I got married...
Manendra wouldn't have it.

419
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,238
My husband is a good man.

420
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,701
He helps many people.

421
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:17,746
He cares about people.

422
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:25,796
Please, would you...
pray with me to Shri Ganesh?

423
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:29,008
Tell Shri Ganesh he's a g... good man?

424
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,593
Of course.

425
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,138
Thank you.

426
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,258
Your father and I visit here sometimes.

427
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,555
We sit with them.

428
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,267
He plays music.

429
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:23,604
How many times
have I heard that fucking song?

430
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:30,778
One time, it was too cold.

431
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:34,156
I told him I didn't want to go.

432
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,577
I said it was stupid
and a waste of time because...

433
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,704
nothing mattered to them anymore.

434
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:49,254
He told me he didn't do it for them.

435
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:53,383
He said he did it
whenever he missed you.

436
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:23,455
I'm sorry I haven't come back.

437
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,922
I wasn't strong enough.

438
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:46,228
I thought I... I would stand here
and want to die again.

439
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,859
Or worse, that I would stand here
and not want to.

440
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:23,724
Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror
and I don't know who I am.

441
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:34,151
I still think of you...
coming to my school.

442
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:47,706
Come with me.

443
00:38:56,798 --> 00:39:00,052
It's like something
that happened to someone else.

444
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,889
The me that loved you...

445
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:09,061
that wanted to have
a huge family with you...

446
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,898
that me's not this me.

447
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,277
That me is here with you.

448
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:26,494
And with you.

449
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:05,575
Oh, honey!

450
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,162
Oh...

451
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,956
OK.

452
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,543
Oh...

453
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,132
I knew you'd be here.

454
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,050
I knew you'd find me.

455
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,721
You all right?

456
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,099
I am now.

457
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:53,748
Hello.

458
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,211
How's Iceland?

459
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:01,756
You'd rather be here?

460
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:23,362
I know how that is.

461
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:28,409
I spent all night
wishing this day would never come.

462
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:35,040
Do you think other animals
waste as much time as us...

463
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:38,710
wishing for things they know...
they'll never get?

464
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:48,595
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

465
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:54,601
I've never told anyone.

466
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:06,071
I couldn't go to the funeral.

467
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:13,954
He was my husband, I loved him,
but I... I couldn't say goodbye.

468
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:19,084
But you have now.

469
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:27,134
I don't believe it's possible.

470
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:33,307
Death doesn't let you say goodbye.

471
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,727
It just...

472
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,106
carves holes in your life...

473
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,818
in your future...

474
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:49,823
in your heart.

475
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:09,301
My sister was born when I was eight.

476
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,307
She was so small and delicate.

477
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:29,363
I carried her around all the time.

478
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:35,410
Her eyes were huge...
full of so much joy and mischief.

479
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:45,086
I loved her.

480
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:56,890
But we did not have any food.

481
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:02,437
Our mother was unable to produce any milk.

482
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:25,668
If we did not give her to the nuns,
she would have died.

483
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:36,971
Saying goodbye was the...
hardest thing I've ever done.

484
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:53,280
I never saw her again.

485
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:03,164
I cried as if she had died.

486
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,751
In a way, she did.

487
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:14,551
But... in another way...

488
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,554
she lived.

489
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,352
That day, I learned life and death
are always so mixed up together,

490
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:27,897
in the same way
some beginnings are endings...

491
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:32,527
and some endings become beginnings.

492
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:57,218
I know the smart characters always hide
in plain sight, but in our own apartment?

493
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:00,138
They won't look for me here for a while.

494
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:02,474
How can you be sure?

495
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:06,394
I used Will's badge number to BOLO myself.

496
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:10,315
"Last seen getting
on a plane to Australia."

497
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:12,150
Australia?

498
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:18,198
We do have friends we could stay with.

499
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:21,242
No.

500
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:23,620
Not after what happened to your mom.

501
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:26,373
I don't want my trouble
hurting anybody else.

502
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,711
You mean "our" trouble.

503
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:47,537
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

504
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,000
Hernando, please pick up the phone,
OK? It's Lito again.

505
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:02,636
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

506
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:07,265
Hernando, it's me again.

507
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:09,934
Call me back.
It's really important.

508
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:22,614
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

509
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,660
Hernando!

510
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:30,913
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

511
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:33,875
Hernando, it's me.

512
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,919
Please call me back. I lost a flip-flop.

513
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:40,381
The bathtub doesn't work. Um...

514
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,262
I cannot get it to work, Hernando.

515
00:48:51,434 --> 00:48:54,228
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

516
00:48:54,312 --> 00:48:56,147
Just call me back.

517
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,231
It's very important.

518
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:14,248
Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

519
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,837
Hernando... it's me again.

520
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:25,092
Look, I...
I understand why you won't pick up.

521
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:26,553
This is my fault.

522
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:33,351
I've always tried
to be worthy of your love, but now...

523
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:43,361
Now I'm not...

524
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:50,368
I disappointed you, I...
I've let you down.

525
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:53,162
I've let Daniela down.

526
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:03,464
Hernando, I...

527
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:06,593
I miss you.

528
00:50:08,344 --> 00:50:09,888
I miss your voice.

529
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:15,184
I have all these voices in my head,
but yours...

530
00:50:17,729 --> 00:50:20,481
it's the only one I can't live without.

531
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,275
- I...
- Mailbox is full.

532
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:32,827
Hernando...

00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,167
I'm sorry.

534
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:45,757
I'm sorry.

535
00:50:48,384 --> 00:50:50,511
I'm... I'm sorry.

536
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:24,128
It's fake.

537
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:26,631
It's fake...

538
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,300
like everything in my life.

539
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:33,013
I'm a fake.

540
00:51:34,347 --> 00:51:36,349
I'm a liar.

541
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:39,686
All I know how to do is lie.
