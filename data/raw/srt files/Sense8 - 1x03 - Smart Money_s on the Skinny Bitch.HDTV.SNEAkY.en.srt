00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,512
Don't look at him.

3
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:23,390
That's how he got me.

4
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,212
Good, you're awake.

5
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,589
- What happened? Where am I?
- You were in an accident.

6
00:02:55,672 --> 00:02:59,760
Lucky to be alive. The other officers
who brought you in last night

7
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:03,889
said we should give you special attention,
said you're a hero.

8
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:05,141
Bagged some terrorist.

9
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,103
Jonas.

10
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,021
I gotta go.

11
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,107
You're not going anywhere.

12
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,775
We think you have a concussion,

13
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:17,486
and the MRI is showing
some unusual brain activity.

14
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,489
I'll bet.

15
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,283
Hey... Wait!

16
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:26,120
Hey! I need a doctor!

17
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,208
- <i>Doctor...</i>
- <i>This is my fault.</i>

18
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,880
<i>You mustn't blame yourself.</i>

19
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,966
<i>It was me.</i>

20
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:44,847
<i>You had the perfect life</i>
<i>and I destroyed it. Yes.</i>

21
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,765
- Why do you torture me?
- Oh, come on,

22
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,267
you make me run the lines with you,

23
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:51,270
and I don't get to watch Ms. Thing
ruin my scene?

24
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:54,106
<i>You're completely innocent.</i>

25
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,607
It is true.

26
00:03:56,984 --> 00:04:00,196
Passion is never innocent.

27
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:02,739
Mm...

28
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,453
Aw!

29
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,455
You guys make such an adorable couple.

30
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,460
- Morning.
- Morning.

31
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:16,628
You want an espresso?

32
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,340
Ah! Yes, please.

33
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,345
Go talk to her. Go talk to her.

34
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,347
Go.

35
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,764
You have to talk to her.

36
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:13,954
When I was young,
I wanted to be a zebra.

37
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,457
Not a bad profession.

38
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,295
I liked the idea of not having
to look for food or shelter,

39
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,172
or have responsibility.

40
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,020
I wish I was a zebra.

41
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,191
- Is that so?
- Yes.

42
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:47,737
If I was a zebra,
I would always have friends like them.

43
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:52,368
You would make a very beautiful zebra.

44
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,953
You know the best thing
about being a zebra?

45
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:56,539
Tell me.

46
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:03,587
If we were hungry, we'd just eat grass
and we wouldn't be hungry anymore.

47
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:06,631
Don't worry.

48
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:10,844
As long as we're together,
something good is going to happen.

49
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:17,934
Soon we'll be stuffing our bellies
fuller than any zebra.

50
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:24,358
Though you must never have seen a zebra
after a lion has had its way with it.

51
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,443
A lot more worse than this.

52
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:31,740
- Lion is definitely a downside.
- Mm.

53
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,701
I'll tell you something
my father told me.

54
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:37,704
As long as you're determined,
and you work hard,

55
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,998
you can be anything you want to be.

56
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,793
And if there's one person
who can be a zebra in this world,

57
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,379
it's you, my friend.

58
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,632
It is good advice.

59
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,387
What did you tell your father
you wanted to be to receive such advice?

60
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,514
Son of a rich man.

61
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,105
- Daniela?
- Oh.

62
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:06,108
- I...
- This place is incredible.

63
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:10,362
I mean, it's a cliché, but you gay guys
really know how to decorate, huh?

64
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:15,284
I... I wanted
to talk to you about last night.

65
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,620
Oh, my God, so much fun.

66
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:23,166
I think we might have had...
a bit of a misunderstanding with...

67
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,876
Did... Did I overstep?

68
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,714
Oh, I'm so sorry if I got carried away.
It's just that... I love gay porn.

69
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,138
No, I'm not talking about
that part of last night.

70
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:41,310
I'm-I'm just feeling that,
Daniela, this is a situation that, um...

71
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,397
Well, maybe it's not
the situation that, um...

72
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,402
Uh, Lito isn't sure
we need a live-in beard.

73
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:55,240
- Yes, I mean...
- Oh.

74
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:03,248
I see. So as long as I didn't know
the truth, you were fine with using me,

75
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:07,836
making me feel like you cared about me,
but... now that I know the truth,

76
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,299
you'd prefer to dump me,
move on and use someone else?

77
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,259
- No, no, no, no.
- Interesting.

78
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,803
I've said the exact same thing to him.

79
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:18,555
Lito, I like this girl.

80
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,144
- I thought you liked me, too.
- Yes. Yes, I do, Daniela. I...

81
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,937
This is our home.

82
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,107
It's... our sacred space.

83
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,862
Uh... And you know, I'll try to...

84
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,490
I'll try...

85
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,534
- Where he gets to be himself.
- Yes.

86
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,910
I would love to get to know the real you.

87
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:46,375
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Um... You know, this...

88
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,835
- Look, Daniela...
- Whoa.

89
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,964
You saying this, it makes me feel...

90
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:55,718
I mean, it's...
It's kind of uncomfortable.

91
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,845
Lito.

92
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:04,476
Because you're being honest with me,
I... I want to be honest with you.

93
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,272
Um, there's another reason why
I didn't want to go home last night.

94
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,858
There's this guy.

95
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:14,778
He knows my family and uh,
he's got it into his head

96
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,155
that he was going to marry me.

97
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:21,785
But he's not one of those people
that you say "no" to, so I...

98
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:26,164
I did something, and I just...

99
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:29,334
I need a place to crash
while things cool down with him.

100
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,337
- What did you do?
- Mm-hm.

101
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,674
Fucked his best friend.

102
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:57,279
Yo, hero.
You're the man of the hour.

103
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:59,239
Agent Stiles,
I was just looking for you...

104
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:02,200
I appreciate your work ethic,
but you shouldn't even be vertical.

105
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,911
- It's about Jonas.
- Yeah, don't worry. We got him.

106
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,789
I want to talk to him.

107
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,540
- You want to what?
- I just...

108
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,104
You need to get back to the hospital
and get your head checked.

109
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:13,336
Five minutes, that's all I need.

110
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,880
Even I wanted to give you access
to this guy, and I don't,

111
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,173
it's out of my hands.

112
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:19,175
Homeland Security
sent over a car to pick him up

113
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,762
and transport him over
to another facility for questioning.

114
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,640
- When?
- Well, that's need to know only.

115
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,517
He's on lockdown. Hey, you're a hero.

116
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,562
Enjoy your five minutes of fame,
and stop trying to make six out of it.

117
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,031
Oh, you shouldn't be out of bed.

118
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,784
It's safer for you in the bed.

119
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,953
There's nothing safe about this place.

120
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:49,080
We are trying to help you.

121
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:51,333
I know that you cannot
understand that right now,

122
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,376
but that's because you're unwell.

123
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,545
How can this be legal?

124
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,841
I need you to get back into your bed.

125
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:02,302
I can't believe that this is
happening to me in the 21st century.

126
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:05,347
Dr. Metzger needs you
on this medication...

127
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,265
This is like some
crazy witch-burning shit.

128
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,893
...twenty-four hours
before your surgery.

129
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,313
No, I told you,
I won't take any medication.

130
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:20,529
I've been instructed to use force,
Nomi, if you will not cooperate.

131
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:23,615
No. No, no. No.

132
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,074
No.

133
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,623
How long do you think
you'll need to stay with us?

134
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:35,168
As long as it takes for things
between Joaquin and me to cool down.

135
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,295
Joaquin? That's the guy?

136
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:40,048
What about the best friend?
Where is he?

137
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,011
He and Joaquin... had words.

138
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:46,930
They had words?

139
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,474
And now I think he's in San Diego.

140
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,644
"They had words."

141
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,023
In a movie, that would mean
someone is in the hospital.

142
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,943
This isn't a movie, Lito.

143
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,824
So, you said Joaquin
was a friend of your family.

144
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:08,451
He worked for my father
for a long time.

145
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,620
What does your father do?

146
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,289
Import/export.

147
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,377
What does he import/export?

148
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,923
Stuff people want, I guess.

149
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,390
How serious was this thing
between you and Joaquin?

150
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:35,061
It started my last year
at university in San Diego.

151
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,774
He'd call me every time
he was in town,

152
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:42,527
and at first, it was fun, casual.

153
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:46,364
But then he got serious, and...

154
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:52,036
My turn.

155
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:56,666
So, how did you pick me to be your beard?

156
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,965
My agent showed me your head shot.

157
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,674
Aw!

158
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:06,342
You liked my head shot?

159
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,222
It was between you and Gloria Sanchez.

160
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:14,142
- Gloria Sanchez?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,518
That skank?

162
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,813
Yes.

163
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,689
And what was the tiebreaker?

164
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,318
Hernando.

165
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,863
He thought you had kind eyes.

166
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:29,407
Said we'd make a better couple.

167
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,953
He's not the only one.

168
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,630
Are you enjoying this?

169
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:47,801
Are you kidding?
This is the best part I've ever had.

170
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:04,228
Please, Sun,
take care of your brother.

171
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:09,067
Do this for me.

172
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,377
Help me.

173
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,135
Help me, Will.

174
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,709
Ms. Bak?

175
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:12,505
I have Mr. Jeong from Seoul Citibank
on the line again.

176
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,841
He sounded very upset.

177
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:21,305
He told me to tell you
that if you don't pick up the phone...

178
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:25,060
his next call will have to be
to the authorities.

179
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,493
I need to speak with my father.

180
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:45,747
Yes, I know, Ms. Bak.
I have left messages for him.

181
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,207
He has not returned.

182
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,001
Tell me where he is
and I'll go to him.

183
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:53,671
I can't do that,
because I don't know where he is.

184
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,674
- Do you want to leave another message?
- A message?

185
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,404
You're coming with me, aren't you?

186
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,073
- Riley!
- Hey.

187
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,866
Hello, my love.

188
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,702
- Riley, Bambie. Bambie, Riley.
- Hi.

189
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:26,947
This is, um... this is the one
I was telling you about.

190
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,248
Right! You're a DJ.

191
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:31,834
- Yeah, you work with Shugs.
- No, no, not a DJ, the DJ.

192
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,629
- Best I ever saw. It was amazing.
- Ah!

193
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:38,382
Uh, listen, I could use some help.

194
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:40,384
Yeah.

195
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:42,553
Aw, looks like you could use a pint,
to start.

196
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,639
- Yeah.
- You all right?

197
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:46,266
- Mm-hm.
- Come on then.

198
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:48,268
You sure you're all right?

199
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,481
You see, the problem is
that they look exactly the same.

200
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:55,984
They come in the same package.

201
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,114
- They have the same identifying features.
- What are you doing here? Are you mad?

202
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,490
- What?
- To the naked eye,

203
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:05,368
- no different from the real thing.
- Your wedding is in two days.

204
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,745
I'm getting married, not lobotomized.

205
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,998
The packaging is coated
in quality control.

206
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,083
If I was marrying that man...

207
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:16,296
- We believe the counterfeiters...
- ...I'd let him lobotomize me all day.

208
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,132
work within companies
like yours...

209
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:25,429
often substituting
counterfeit drugs for the real ones...

210
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,434
sometimes just cutting the dose
to cut costs.

211
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:36,149
But these tampered-with drugs
are killing people

212
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,943
who are not getting
the proper medication.

213
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:45,533
- You know, maybe it is not a good idea.
- No, you have to trust me.

214
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,618
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

215
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:50,246
Supply, demand, gross, net.

216
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,123
- Bottom line, give me your money.
- What?

217
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:56,378
Give me your money, unless you want your
mother to spend another night in pain.

218
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:04,802
Yes. One, two, three, four, five...
Eight? Eight hundred bob?

219
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,642
I do love a challenge.

220
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,894
Whoo!

221
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:14,437
Hey, hi, my friend.

222
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,606
And how is it going, Mr...?

223
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,068
- Fuck off.
- Oh, you're Mr. Fuck Off.

224
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:22,528
I mistook you for someone
who wants to make some money.

225
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:24,155
What I sell here you can't afford.

226
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,824
Oh, is that true? Wait. Phone.

227
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,285
Uh, who's calling?

228
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,704
Oh. Yeah?

229
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,374
What?

230
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,919
No, I'm here now.

231
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,795
No, you gave this address.

232
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:44,717
Yes. No, this... Construction site down...

233
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,719
Come on, G.

234
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,183
Sorry, guys, wrong place. Let us go.

235
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:55,937
- I thought this was Gorgo's.
- Gorgo? That guy's merch is shit.

236
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,065
Is that true?
He said that your shit's totally cut.

237
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:02,485
Fuck him. I sell the cleanest drugs
in the whole of Nairobi.

238
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:03,778
Everybody knows it.

239
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,489
Sure, Fuck Off, whatever you say.

240
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,658
Come, what do you need?

241
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,661
- Well, uh...
- My mother is sick with AIDS

242
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,914
and the medicine she's taking
is making her sicker.

243
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,750
AIDS medicine don't make people sick.

244
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,421
It's counterfeit and watered-down
medicine that has side effects.

245
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:26,509
Cramps, diarrhea, pain. Mostly pain.

246
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:31,931
She needs Lortab, Norco.
But this is very expensive.

247
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,059
Cheaper to let her die.

248
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,103
- Fuck...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, relax.

249
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:40,315
Hey. No, relax. Easy, easy.

250
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,484
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
some of his jokes.

251
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,277
Just relax. Relax!

252
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,447
How much for the Norco?

253
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,573
- Twenty-five.
- What?

254
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:52,452
Gorgo's got it online
for half that price.

255
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,789
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

256
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:58,500
- Ten-fifty.
- Six-fifty.

257
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:01,877
- Are you trying to fuck with me?
- Fuck, Mr. Fuck Off?

258
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:05,089
- OK, nine.
- Eight.

259
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,427
Deal.

260
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:28,404
My money.

261
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,366
Why don't you pick it up yourself
and uh... fuck off?

262
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,080
Should try what I did
when me and my ex broke up.

263
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:41,501
I snuck into our flat
and put super glue on the toilet seat.

264
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:44,045
Firemen had to come
and cut him away from the loo.

265
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,255
Fucking cunt hobbled
to the emergency room

266
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,966
with half the dunny
hanging off his ass.

267
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:53,888
Don't mind Bambie, Riley.
She can be a bit forward.

268
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:58,809
I actually think she's got
a touch of Asperger's.

269
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,936
Asperger's?

270
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,647
I don't have Asperger's.

271
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,608
I'm fuckin' Australian.

272
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,072
Whose side are you on?
He threw her out on the street.

273
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:16,452
Look, I never fancied ol' Jacko.

274
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:19,914
He was a dickhead.
You do deserve better.

275
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,266
Tino! Tino, please!

276
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,602
Don't do this! Please.

277
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,520
- Please, don't go in there.
- I must.

278
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:45,273
- Please, I beg of...
- I must.

279
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,815
My destiny is a bullet.

280
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:50,361
The one I put in him or the one...

281
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:53,197
he puts in me.

282
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,868
And that's a cut!

283
00:24:57,952 --> 00:24:59,995
Eh! Very nice! Yes!

284
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,372
Lito, beautiful.

285
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:03,583
Thank you very much, eh? OK.

286
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,946
- Are you sure you got it?
- Yes.

287
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,377
Can I do one more, please?

288
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:10,590
I was thinking, should I be playing here
that she's gonna betray me?

289
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,342
No, you don't know. How could you know?

290
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:16,429
Listen, listen... I know.

291
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:18,806
I think my character might feel it.

292
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:23,060
The audience doesn't know.
The audience is with you. They are you.

293
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,020
When you know, they know.

294
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,732
But I do know.

295
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,361
Know what, love?

296
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,031
Nothing.

297
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,160
You gotta go through that door.

298
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:41,829
There's nowhere else for you to go.

299
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:47,710
Now, walk with me.
There's someone you need to meet.

300
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:55,426
Um, welcome to my humble abode.
<i>El palacio el Shugsio.</i>

301
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:04,101
So, Lito, this is Mr. Flores.

302
00:26:06,228 --> 00:26:09,940
Please... call me Joaquin.

303
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,402
Joaquin?

304
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,156
How do you guys know each other?

305
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:20,075
I'm a really good friend
of Mr. Moreno.

306
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,911
You know, the guy who signs our checks?

307
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:25,080
He wants to take you out to lunch.

308
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,082
Between us, he's a big fan.

309
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,253
I've watched<i> The Passion of the Sinner</i>
a thousand times.

310
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:35,132
And if it's on,
I always watch it till the end.

311
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,844
You're my hero.

312
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:46,227
Do you know what Mitchie said about you?

313
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,314
He says, "Shugs,
there's two reasons to go to Iceland:

314
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,901
the aurora borealis, and Riley Blue.

315
00:26:53,984 --> 00:27:00,241
One is a natural phenomenon
so beautiful it will blow your mind,

316
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:03,869
and the other is just
some pretty lights in the sky."

317
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,457
Thanks, Shugs.

318
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,252
You're from Iceland?

319
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,464
Do you miss it?

320
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,009
I miss my dad.

321
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,263
He's a pianist.

322
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:24,724
I miss listening to him practice.

323
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:26,809
Mm. My dad was a drunk,

324
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:30,605
and I miss the way we'd find him sleeping
in a different place every morning.

325
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,149
Chip off the old block, this one.

326
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:38,821
What else?

327
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:42,908
I miss the winter.

328
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:46,203
Just so quiet and still...

329
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:50,750
you can hear your own heart beat.

330
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,377
I'd go balmy in so much darkness.

331
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,133
Actually, most Icelanders go crazy
in the spring when the sun comes back.

332
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:02,928
I know so many people who
tried to kill themselves in the spring.

333
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,518
That when you tried?

334
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,023
Sorry, love. Australian.

335
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:20,154
Hey, Riles... look.

336
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:28,078
Every time I wake up in hospital and
someone tells me I'm lucky to be alive,

337
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,164
I get another one.

338
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:36,879
Riley, anyone watching
what really goes on in this world,

339
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:39,423
how fucked up it all is...

340
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:47,431
like... checking out,
temporarily, permanently...

341
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:53,020
my darling, it is the only choice
that makes any sense.

342
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:21,590
I'll walk.

343
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:44,196
What you actors do, playing all those
different people, is amazing.

344
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:49,952
Actors are just good liars, Joaquin.

345
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,871
One of my favorite scenes

346
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:55,624
was that one where you
killed your father when he's sleeping.

347
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,626
<i>Our Father Who Art in Hell.</i>

348
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,962
Exactly. That one.

349
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:03,424
You walked up to him,
cover his mouth,

350
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:07,553
and you say, "No more lies."

351
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:11,974
And then you drag the knife
through his throat.

352
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:18,397
Wow! How did you do that?

353
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,982
What do you mean?

354
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:24,695
It's a prosthetic.

355
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,031
- Oh.
- It's a fake neck that gets cut.

356
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:31,368
Ah. I love it. Really, I love it.

357
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,204
But listen, you cannot
kill a man like that.

358
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:37,249
If you want to do it right,

359
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,042
you aim here...

360
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,254
for the jugular. Huh?

361
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:44,715
Otherwise, you have
to hack through the windpipe,

362
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,636
then the neck bone, and things
can get really, really, messy.

363
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:52,431
A lot of thrashing around
till they drown in their own blood.

364
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:57,060
Something of an expert, then?

365
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:00,898
It's more like a hobby.

366
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:06,111
Look...

367
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,490
you know why I'm here, don't you?

368
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:14,787
You're fucking the love of my life.

369
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,958
When I heard she was seeing someone...

370
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:23,879
and I'm gonna be
really honest with you, Lito...

371
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:27,967
it drove me a little bit loco,

372
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,972
because I couldn't stop thinking
of how we used to lay in bed

373
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:36,475
and look at the selfies
she took with her past lovers,

374
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:38,560
and how we used to make fun of them.

375
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:52,908
But it turned out to be you.

376
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:55,077
So what could I do?

377
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,873
If I were a girl,
I would also love to fuck you.

378
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:07,673
I want to know just one thing,
and then you will never see me again.

379
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,261
Is she happy?

380
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:16,974
Yes.

381
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:20,019
She told me she's never been happier.

382
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,110
You did it.

383
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,489
Just like I show you.

384
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:35,034
Right for the jugular.

385
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:41,164
But you should have used a knife.

386
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,052
This is under production.

387
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,013
It's free.
You don't have to pay.

388
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:59,224
Sooner or later, we all have to pay.

389
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:25,167
Somebody...
Somebody help me, please.

390
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,464
I knew you would be back.

391
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:33,508
This is where you belong.

392
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:35,844
You can pretend.

393
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:38,847
You can act the way others
want you to act.

394
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:40,891
You can bury your heart.

395
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:46,229
But I know you will always come back.

396
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:54,655
Good.

397
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,418
OK, put her under.

398
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:17,636
What the hell is going on?

399
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:21,598
The fire department is proceeding

400
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:23,976
with a non-critical evacuation
of the building.

401
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,645
Some lunatic set fire
to the visitors' room.

402
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:31,608
This patient's under medical quarantine.
Get her back in the room.

403
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,365
<i>It's gonna be OK.</i>

404
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:41,576
<i>Something is going on,</i>
<i>I don't know what it is, but until we do,</i>

405
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,747
I will burn this building down before
I let anyone touch that beautiful brain.

406
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:49,251
Oh... Thank you, Neets.

407
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:52,796
Thank you.

408
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,341
Thank you.

409
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:10,147
Hey, you promised no stopping here.
Bad area.

410
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:12,149
We aren't full.
We need the money.

411
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:17,738
See?

412
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:25,453
Oh, shit!

413
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:33,545
Get out!

414
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:43,513
OK, motherfuckers,
let's do this real quick.

415
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:45,682
Money, wallet, and food!

416
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,394
So give us the money, bitch!

417
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:55,109
- This is it?
- We just started. It's all I've got.

418
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,273
- You holding out, eh?
- No.

419
00:35:56,277 --> 00:35:57,903
- You better not be holding out!
- No.

420
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:58,987
Faster, woman, faster!

421
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,203
Please.

422
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,413
Please don't. Please don't.

423
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:12,709
We are the Superpower!
We take the fuck we want!

424
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:13,793
Please.

425
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:21,051
You ain't got no dick this big.

426
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,636
Check him!

427
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,815
Please!

428
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,566
- You lied to me? I'll kill you.
- Please.

429
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,820
This is medicine for my mother.
I need it! I need it. She's dying, OK?

430
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:42,030
- Back off me, bitch!
- I will drive for you.

431
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:43,448
I'll do whatever you want!

432
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:48,745
Fucking bitch! You and your
whore mother can fuck off and die!

433
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:00,882
Whoo!

434
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:50,057
Yeah!

435
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:04,487
Yeah! Whoo-whoo!

436
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,199
What the hell is this?

437
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:10,411
There is nothing in the rules
about gender.

438
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:13,247
Are you kidding me?
This has to be a joke.

439
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,584
I'm not fighting that skinny bitch.
I'll kill her.

440
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:22,505
Yeah? Then you forfeit the match,
and your money.

441
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:24,883
Bullshit.

442
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:31,681
Actually, this is a very cheap price
to save yourself much humiliation.

443
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,558
What?

444
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:38,063
Smart money is on the skinny bitch.

445
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,588
We need to keep going to the city.

446
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,305
No.

447
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:14,141
What are you doing?

448
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:16,393
I'm going to get the medicine back.

449
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:19,354
- Don't talk crazy, Capheus.
- Anyone who doesn't want to come with me

450
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:21,689
- should get off the bus now.
- Capheus, please.

451
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:24,318
- I don't expect you to come with me.
- We're partners.

452
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:26,820
You have Elena. You have the kids.

453
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:27,984
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

454
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,709
- Start the car. I'm coming with you.
- No.

455
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:33,535
No.

456
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:36,497
I'd follow you anywhere.

457
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:40,334
I know. It's OK.

458
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:51,761
My husband gave me that ring
43 years ago.

459
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:54,556
It's all I have left of him.

460
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,477
Let's go get it.

461
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,153
May Jean-Claude protect you.

462
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:17,662
Yeah!

463
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,668
Fighters...

464
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:28,465
fight!

465
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:12,675
Aah! Fuck!

466
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:23,353
Go, go, go, go, go!

467
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:40,328
Yah!

468
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,307
Fuck!

469
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,356
Help me.

470
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:37,738
Help me, please.

471
00:43:54,254 --> 00:43:57,257
I'll kill you fucking slow.

472
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:16,818
Fuck!

473
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:21,281
Aah!

474
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,830
Aah!

475
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:49,225
I'll fuck you, Van Damme.

476
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,533
He is Van Damme.

477
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,370
Yeah! Whoo!

478
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:12,999
Winner!
