00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,376
(wind howling)

3
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:18,518
(heart monitor beeps steadily)

4
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,564
(whispers) I'm so cold.

5
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,486
Why is there no heat?

6
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,237
(exhales)

7
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,616
(heart monitor echoes)

8
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,284
(whispers) Riley.

9
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:37,412
(whispers) Magnus.

10
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,874
Come with me.

11
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,339
You stupid girl.

12
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,177
I told you this would happen.

13
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,016
(voice breaks) I'm sorry.

14
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:02,604
You've been apologizing
your whole life.

15
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,441
You won't have to anymore.

16
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,153
- (gasps softly)
- (Yrsa) Yes...

17
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,160
you're going to die here.

18
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,875
- (gasps)
- What? God, what? Nomi! Wh-- What is it?

19
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,335
They know what she is.
They're gonna cut her open.

20
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:28,212
They're gonna turn her into a Bolger.
We gotta do something.

21
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:29,631
Bu-- What?

22
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,716
We need information.

23
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
We need to know if BPO has been alerted,
if someone's made the diagnosis...

24
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,596
I could hack into the hospital
in a second,

25
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,016
but I don't have any equipment.
They took everything.

26
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,019
Can't you... use your police codes
or something and call them?

27
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,937
- Is that the cop?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,397
I was suspended.

29
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,649
- Great.
- What?

30
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,776
- He got suspended.
- Great.

31
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,196
(Nomi) What do we do?

32
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:53,488
(knocking at door)

33
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,952
I-- I wouldn't answer that.

34
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,955
No one looking for a fugitive
would knock like that.

35
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:09,713
(Neets breathes heavily, gasps)

36
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:12,883
Bug!

37
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,802
Hello, Angels.

38
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,514
Bug, what are you doing here?

39
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,433
Feds are funny, you know.

40
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:25,729
They spend all that money
protecting things that nobody cares about.

41
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:28,398
Then they leave
the real information lying around

42
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,443
like a Post-it note on a refrigerator.

43
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:36,823
For instance, when they confiscate
illegal electronic equipment,

44
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,409
it's inventoried to a site...

45
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:42,370
that's like a shopping list
to a guy like me.

46
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,750
So-- Thank you, baby.

47
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:51,838
So when I saw exactly the things
that I had just sold you posted,

48
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:56,218
well... the Bug suspected foul play.

49
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:02,599
Oh, I-- I don't have
any money to pay you, Bug.

50
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,144
I didn't come for money.

51
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:09,022
I'd still be in prison
if it weren't for you, Mike.

52
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:12,234
I mean Nomi. Nomi.

53
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:17,948
Look, I don't know what kind of fight
you're getting yourself into, but...

54
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:24,913
I do know... you can't shoot back
without any bullets in your gun.

55
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,206
So...

56
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,212
consider yourselves... reloaded.

57
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:34,840
Oh...

58
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,140
Hey, partner. What's up?

59
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,975
I thought we agreed
we'd be starting tomorrow.

60
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:49,395
(sighs) We did, but, uh...
there's something I have to do,

61
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,647
and I need a favor.

62
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:52,316
Who's this?

63
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,947
Hey, beautiful girl. I'm Jela.
What's your name?

64
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:02,868
I'm Amondi Kabaka.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Jela.

65
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,623
I was hoping she could stay here with you.

66
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:13,003
I believe someone else
will come by later to collect her.

67
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,379
Where will you be?

68
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,966
If it gets too late...

69
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,511
here is the number of her French teacher.

70
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,848
She will know what to do.

71
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,518
Capheus... where are you going?

72
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,188
I have to settle a debt.

73
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:34,649
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- (Capheus chuckles)

74
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,320
Van Damme always comes back.

75
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,745
Take care of her, Jela.

76
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:48,872
I will.

77
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,963
(Jela) Hey, Van Damme.

78
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,259
See you tomorrow.

79
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:14,439
(Rajan) The doctors are saying
it's a miracle he's still alive.

80
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,567
I'm not sure which
would upset my father more:

81
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,445
the idea of fanatics trying to kill him,

82
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,948
or a god getting credit for saving him.

83
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,285
How is your mother?

84
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:33,417
As he improves, she becomes convinced...
that it's because she's praying again.

85
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:35,085
She wants to go to the temple with you.

86
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,507
Rajan? I know you
want to get back to the hospital...

87
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,928
It's actually nice to get outside,

88
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:45,845
so thank you.

89
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,764
Though I am a little nervous about

90
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,474
what you've been wanting to talk about.

91
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:56,689
It's about... something I didn't
tell the police when they questioned me

92
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,358
about the attack on your father.

93
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:03,405
It had no bearing on what happened.
It was... a private matter.

94
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:07,326
As such,
I felt that I should tell only you.

95
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,204
Your father did not want us
to get married.

96
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,459
He told me that he had reconsidered
and asked me to say no to you,

97
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,210
for your own good.

98
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,504
He thought that we were not well matched.

99
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,844
What did you say?

100
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,763
There was no time
to say very much of anything.

101
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:34,894
How difficult it must have been
for you to hold all this inside.

102
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,064
I thought it was important
for you to know.

103
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,278
A lesser woman would have said
he wished us well,

104
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:45,864
that he wanted us
to be married no matter what...

105
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,658
and he gave us his blessings.

106
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,743
And I would have known that she was lying.

107
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,206
You knew he was against our marriage?

108
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:55,999
Of course.

109
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,629
So is that what I was to you?

110
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:05,217
- An act of rebellion against your father?
- Never.

111
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,219
I told you the truth.

112
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:09,554
Maybe it added a bit of spice
to my attraction to you,

113
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:12,391
but it has nothing to do
with why I asked you to marry me.

114
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,396
I want you to marry me,
not to be for or against anyone else,

115
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,565
because I love you,
I trust you...

116
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:24,027
and I can imagine no better life
than growing old with you.

117
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:30,658
All I need to know now is...

118
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,081
after everything that has happened,
do you still want to marry me?

119
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,422
(typing)

120
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:51,971
(Nomi) OK, I fixed it so that
any information, requisition or test

121
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:55,934
that goes out with her name on it
will look like spam to other computers.

122
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:58,144
Great. So she's safe.

123
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:01,106
I figure they would've moved her
somewhere more secure if they knew,

124
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,024
like they did to me.

125
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,486
- (sighs) Her poor father.
- Yeah.

126
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,072
He's been there the whole time.

127
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,456
(singing "Baba O'Riley")

128
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,099
How is she?

129
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,480
She's still in the ICU...
but she's not alone.

130
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:42,790
(indistinct chatter)

131
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,837
(man whistles)

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,173
(men cheering)

133
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:53,176
- (speaks Swahili)
- (excited chatter)

134
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,137
(shouts in Swahili)

135
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,482
(speaking Swahili)

136
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:22,997
You are a smart man, Van Damme!

137
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,506
(singsong) Come on out.

138
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,301
Eh?

139
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:36,969
(chattering in Swahili)

140
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,179
It's empty!

141
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,181
Where is she?

142
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,642
Amondi. Where the fuck is the girl?!

143
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:45,520
She has nothing to do with this.

144
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,480
(screams) Bullshit!

145
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,608
She's Kabaka's daughter.

146
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,359
(Capheus) She's just a child.

147
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,820
He killed my sister.

148
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,865
I'm here because
you have a quarrel with me,

149
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:01,244
not my mother... and not a child.

150
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,664
Let us settle our debt...

151
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,125
like men.

152
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,352
(metal scraping)

153
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:31,941
Like men?

154
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,700
Like men?!

155
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,287
Like men?!

156
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:52,253
(laughter)

157
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,755
Like men!

158
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,682
You are hilarious.

159
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:04,974
I like you, Van Damme.

160
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,434
Come!

161
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,439
- Walk!
- (chatter in Swahili)

162
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,650
(men cheering)

163
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,823
You have a visitor.

164
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,973
Sun...

165
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,141
(guard) No touching!

166
00:14:58,695 --> 00:14:59,863
Sister...

167
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,116
it's good to see you.

168
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,620
What are you doing here, Joong-Ki?

169
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,960
(sighs) There's no easy way to say this.

170
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,259
Last night, Father was very upset.

171
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:22,968
He was drinking.

172
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,387
You know how he can be.

173
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,140
I told him to go home.

174
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:29,726
He said he couldn't.

175
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:35,690
He said he was a failure, that he deserved
no home, that he deserved to die.

176
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,861
I couldn't listen to him anymore.

177
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:40,945
I left.

178
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:44,657
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

179
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,287
I have to live with that mistake.

180
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,878
We had a meeting this morning.

181
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,004
He never showed up.

182
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,173
I had everyone looking for him.

183
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,929
I had a lunch...
when the police showed up.

184
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,102
They found him.

185
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,397
He was in his car.

186
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:20,234
A hose connected
the exhaust to the window.

187
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,322
But the police are wrong.

188
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,033
He didn't kill himself.

189
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,621
It was shame.

190
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,539
Like a kind of cancer.

191
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,960
Shame killed our father.

192
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,258
Sun... we cannot blame ourselves, OK?

193
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:48,513
What happened was beyond our control.

194
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:52,433
But I didn't want you
to hear it from someone else.

195
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,769
That's why I had to come myself.

196
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,443
(breath quivering)

197
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,445
I'm so sorry.

198
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:19,711
At least... we still have each other.

199
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,321
You killed him.

200
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:52,577
You... killed him.

201
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,044
(sniffles)
Sun... I know this is a terrible blow.

202
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:04,255
He was going
to tell the truth to the court,

203
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:09,093
so you had to stop him,
because you're afraid of prison.

204
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,227
(sniffs)

205
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,520
Sun...

206
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:23,608
do not say something
you're going to regret.

207
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,071
The police said it was a suicide.

208
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:32,075
You murdered... our father.

209
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,461
(whispers) I was nowhere near him.

210
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,135
(sniffs) OK...

211
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,512
obviously, you're upset.

212
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,433
(Sun screams)

213
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:00,144
(Joong-Ki grunts)

214
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:05,817
(Joong-Ki) Help!

215
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,861
- (guard) Hey! Hey!
- (Joong-Ki) Help!

216
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:09,988
(Joong-Ki screams)

217
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,782
(Sun shouts, grunts)

218
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:14,033
Look at me.

219
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,493
Look at me, Joong-Ki!

220
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,162
I know what you did.

221
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:19,413
You will pay.

222
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:22,541
I swear it!

223
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,963
- (men cheering)
- (man shouts in Swahili)

224
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:31,258
- (in English) Superpower!
- (cheering)

225
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:34,178
(men chatter in Swahili)

226
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,430
(cheering)

227
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,349
Bring out the bitch!

228
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:58,703
We've been trying
to house-train her, but...

229
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:02,915
once a street bitch,
always a street bitch.

230
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,044
- (grunts)
- (coughing)

231
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,004
Keeps pissing herself.

232
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,922
(whimpers softly)

233
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:13,968
See... I was going
to make this bitch watch me

234
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:17,596
as I killed the only thing
in her life that mattered.

235
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:21,017
But... I have a better idea.

236
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:22,685
(snaps fingers)

237
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,481
(Silas whimpering)

238
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:35,489
I want you to do the honor
and put this bitch out of her misery.

239
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,207
You do it.

240
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:11,943
You cut her fucking head off...
and we'll call our debt even.

241
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,529
It's a little dull.

242
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:20,409
You might have to hack a few times...
but you can do it.

243
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:24,080
You are Van-fucking-Damme.
(chuckles)

244
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,960
(whispers) Do it quick!

245
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:41,139
Come on, Van Damme.
Like a man, huh?

246
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:43,641
Like a man!

247
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,284
(Silas sobbing)

248
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,452
What's the problem?

249
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,081
I'll tell you the problem.

250
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,503
The problem is... you aren't a man.

251
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:14,922
You're just another bitch!

252
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,680
(Silas whimpering)

253
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:24,682
Bitch, come on!

254
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,391
(grunting)

255
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:32,940
It's you or him, bitch!

256
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,741
(softly) Call me a bitch one more time...

257
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,368
and I will kill you.

258
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:46,745
Say what?

259
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:49,081
Bitch!

260
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,588
- (screams)
- (Sun shouts)

261
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:59,217
(man screams)

262
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,468
- (Sun) Aah!
- (man shouts)

263
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,273
(grunting) Aah!

264
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:17,902
(chuckles)

265
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,031
(Sun shouts)

266
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,497
(screams)

267
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:45,971
(screams)

268
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:09,287
Van Damme.

269
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,623
Fucking Van Damme.

270
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,001
(sighs)

271
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,505
(engine revving)

272
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,051
What the fuck are you doing here?

273
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,638
(groans)

274
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,732
(screams) Find them!

275
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,926
(Wolfgang) "What's best in life?

276
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,221
Crush your enemies,

277
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,555
see them driven before you,

278
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:55,184
and hear the lamentations
of their women."

279
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:12,910
Thank you.

280
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:18,040
- Thank you.
- No... it's we who should thank you.

281
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:21,377
- This means so much.
- Yes, so much.

282
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,463
Remover of obstacles.

283
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:27,299
As the obstacle to our faith was removed.

284
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:31,136
- What are you... talking--
- She is our hero.

285
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,596
She brought him here.

286
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:37,309
- No.
- Yes. God worked through you.

287
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,854
- No!
- Yes. You brought the defiler to us.

288
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,731
You brought him
where we could reach him at last.

289
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,150
No one likes violence.

290
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,985
God does not like violence.

291
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,487
This is obscene!

292
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:52,491
But he knows...
sometimes it is necessary--

293
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:54,659
No, don't touch me.

294
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:56,828
You have nothing to be afraid of.

295
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:58,621
- You are one of us.
- (man) Yes.

296
00:26:58,705 --> 00:26:59,706
- (woman) Yes.
- No!

297
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,292
(man) You're one of us!

298
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,919
Don't touch her!

299
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:10,551
If I see you... any of you, here again,

300
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,595
I will show you what violence looks like.

301
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,476
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!

302
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,851
Let's go.

303
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:22,687
Thank you.

304
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,607
They'll be back.

305
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:27,359
- So will I.
- Well...

306
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,320
so will I.

307
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:33,532
This is India. Wow.

308
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:36,118
Uh, where are you?

309
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,746
Chicago... sort of.

310
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,206
Sort of?

311
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,666
My thoughts aren't really there.

312
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:47,463
They're with her.

313
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:51,175
(softly) I remember listening to music.

314
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:53,218
Yeah, her father
was playing with the orchestra,

315
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,637
and it triggered something in her.

316
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:58,223
- What is wrong with her?
- I'm not sure.

317
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,101
I'm afraid that soon
they'll realize what she is.

318
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:02,811
And then?

319
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:04,980
I don't know.

320
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,786
- Are we clear?
- I don't know.

321
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,210
Van Damme-- Capheus, thank you.

322
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:28,253
Thank you for not giving them Amondi.

323
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:30,005
I'm going to make you a rich man.

324
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,341
I don't want your money, sir.
You can keep it.

325
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:35,302
Tell me then, why did you save me?

326
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,639
To be honest,
it wasn't exactly a part of my plan.

327
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:43,352
Oh, no!

328
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,385
Any weapons in here? Knives, guns?

329
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,512
No, no, I don't have any weapons.

330
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,607
- Capheus!
- (Will) What is it? What's the matter?

331
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,066
I think I'm about to die.

332
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:33,818
Nobody's gonna die.

333
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:37,489
(grunts)

334
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:48,542
Buckle up!

335
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,590
- (screams)
- (man shouting)

336
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,695
Move, move, move, move. Move!

337
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:19,323
- Fuck!
- (man shouts in Swahili)

338
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:25,412
(horns honking)

339
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,165
Move, move, move!

340
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:31,502
Sorry!

341
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:33,044
(engine revving)

342
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,258
(whispers) Shit!

343
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,137
(tires squealing)

344
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:59,237
(motorcycle approaching)

345
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:03,158
Oh, shit!

346
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:22,803
- (gun clicking)
- Shit!

347
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,527
(engine revving)

348
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:47,703
Is he gone?

349
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:13,520
Let's settle this.

350
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,753
(revving)

351
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:57,147
(screams)

352
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,189
(gunshot)

353
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:04,613
(screaming)

354
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,955
Aah!

355
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:41,274
You will take good care of him,
you understand?

356
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,778
If anyone comes looking
for a man matching his description,

357
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:47,781
you say nothing, you do nothing,
you call me.

358
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:50,492
How long will it be?

359
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:54,997
What I have to do now...
shouldn't take long.

360
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,083
What name should I use?

361
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,882
Conan.

362
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,383
Is that a first name, a last name?

363
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,261
Yes.

364
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:39,958
(indistinct chatter)

365
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:42,920
Try it.

366
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,261
Nice.

367
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:55,098
Capheus!

368
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,268
Capheus...

369
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:02,731
Ah! Capheus!

370
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,357
Oh, my God!

371
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:09,112
I knew you'd come back.

372
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,115
Van Damme always comes back.

373
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,786
Papa, are you all right?

374
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,705
I'm fine.
No, I'm better than fine.

375
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:21,165
I'm lucky.

376
00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:27,005
- Who loves you?
- You do.

377
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:43,563
- (heart monitor beeps steadily)
- (exhales)

378
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,984
(wind howling)

379
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,443
(sharp inhale)

380
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:55,867
(woman) I've never seen anything like it.

381
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:58,161
The growth of the substantia alba.

382
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:00,664
(exhales) I'm so cold.

383
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,083
(Magnus) Here, take my coat.

384
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,084
No.

385
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:10,757
- No!
- (monitor beeps rapidly)

386
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:13,176
I can't believe she can even move
with what we've given her.

387
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,346
Kids today have
huge tolerance for drugs.

388
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:20,350
(heart monitor stabilizes)

389
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:24,146
- Did we hear back from the neurologist?
- Not yet. Still waiting.

390
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:27,482
Did you do that?

391
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:31,069
It was easy.
Hacking's what I do.

392
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:33,155
Did you do this, too?

393
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,785
How'd you get access
to the Australian fugitive alert?

394
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,579
I'm an all-access kind of girl.

395
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:45,792
Looks totally real, doesn't it?

396
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:48,378
I figured it would
buy us a little more time.

397
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:49,796
That's the question.

398
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,840
How much time do we have,
how much time does she have?

399
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,176
None. You're out of time.

400
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:55,593
Jonas.

401
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,095
I told you I made a mistake.

402
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:59,222
I wish there was some way to fix it,
but there's not.

403
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:03,894
I was just afraid if I didn't help you,
you wouldn't be alive right now.

404
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:05,812
That's not a mistake, that's true.

405
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:08,690
No, the mistake was mine.
I should've trusted you.

406
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,526
The real question we face is,
can you trust me now?

407
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,903
Yes.

408
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:15,613
Even when I tell you
that Whispers knows about Riley?

409
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:19,076
How? I have all the information
locked down.

410
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,494
You know about her
and Will knows about her...

411
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:23,997
and I know you.

412
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:29,044
And Whispers... knows me.

413
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,588
Be careful what you tell them.

414
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:34,091
Not too much, or they won't believe you.

415
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:37,719
He's here with me now.

416
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,847
He wants me to tell you
that he's going to Iceland,

417
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:42,682
that he's going to find Riley,

418
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:45,602
and once he does, it won't be long
until he finds the rest of you.

419
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:48,479
And why would he tell us that?
Why not just go straight to Iceland

420
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:50,065
or have Riley arrested?

421
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,859
Tell Will I look forward to meeting him.

422
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:57,864
Don't underestimate him, Will.

423
00:37:57,948 --> 00:38:00,491
He's very good at manipulating people.

424
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:04,162
Right now he's smiling because
he knows the only thought in your head

425
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:06,623
is getting on the next plane to Iceland.

426
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:31,481
This is a bad place.

427
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:34,609
You should not be here.

428
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,657
You don't have to do this.

429
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:44,202
You could just... turn around.

430
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,704
It is so simple a thing, just...

431
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:50,333
just turn the wheel,
and the future changes.

432
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:53,044
- It is not that simple.
- It is.

433
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:55,338
You stopped your wedding,
but it's still going to happen.

434
00:38:58,175 --> 00:38:59,801
You don't know that.

435
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:05,473
Some things in our lives are inevitable.

436
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,768
Don't do this.

437
00:39:08,852 --> 00:39:11,146
They will kill you.

438
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,106
There are worse things than dying.

439
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:17,652
Wolfgang, please!

440
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:22,699
There are things I will never be able
to understand about your world,

441
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,618
just as there are things
you will never understand about mine.

442
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,375
I understand how I feel about you.

443
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,715
And somehow, I know
that you feel the same way about me.

444
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:42,969
This is why I'm here.

445
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,644
After what I did...

446
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:56,649
as long as that man is alive...

447
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:01,363
no one I care about will ever be safe.

448
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:36,898
(console beeps)

449
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:39,525
It's Wolfgang.

450
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:08,888
(Sun) Crying won't help him.

451
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,728
I can feel what you're feeling.

452
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,191
This is what life is.

453
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:26,406
Fear, rage, desire... love.

454
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:34,914
To stop feeling emotions,
to stop wanting to feel them...

455
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,918
is to feel... death.

456
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:42,422
What do you suggest I do?

457
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:47,010
I take everything I am feeling...

458
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,055
everything that matters to me...

459
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:58,646
I push all of it... into my fist...

460
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:04,361
and I fight for it.
