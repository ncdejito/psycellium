2
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,707
This isn't a fair fight.

3
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,877
We need to level the playing field
and that's what this guy does.

4
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,670
And you trust him?

5
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,631
Because you were hackers together?

6
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,717
Because he got caught
hacking the Pentagon during the war.

7
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,677
Couldn't have been very serious.

8
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,055
- It was.
- Then why isn't he in jail?

9
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,350
Because I took the fall for him.

10
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,945
I was a juvenile. I had rich parents.
I got off with community service.

11
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:26,411
I never told you because I didn't think
that I would ever have to revisit

12
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,788
this part of my life.

13
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,253
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:36,255
Attention.

15
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,724
This is Prisoner 773.

16
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,393
Teach her the rules.

17
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,484
It is her.

18
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,611
Here he comes.

19
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:08,371
- The embezzler.
- You stole all of those investors' money?

20
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:12,333
Shamed your father and brother.

21
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,543
And almost destroyed their company.

22
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,884
Well done.

23
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,143
Hey, Bug.

24
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:33,896
Where's Mike?

25
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:38,859
It's me. I'm... Mike.

26
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,652
Oh, shit.

27
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,321
Fuck!

28
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,492
Right, totally forgot.
I'm a fucking idiot.

29
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:52,206
'Course it's you, buddy!

30
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,167
'Course it's you.

31
00:04:55,251 --> 00:05:00,505
Not you, like the old you,
like a new, hot version of you.

32
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,966
Shit, Mike.

33
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,054
You're a total fox!
I would do you! I would.

34
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:10,057
I would totally... I mean not like,

35
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,770
not in a degrading way, like that sounded,
but total compliment.

36
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,189
- Thank you.
- Her name's Nomi.

37
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,816
OK.

38
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,236
- Who's this?
- This is my girlfriend.

39
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:27,074
- Seriously? Shit!
- Bug.

40
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,367
Right.

41
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,328
Business.

42
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:33,247
Everything you need.

43
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,333
Right here.

44
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,212
Hey, look, if you guys are startin'
some crime-fightin' super-team

45
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,257
Charlie's Angels shit,
you count me in.

46
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,760
OK. Let's start you off
with some switch hooks.

47
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,345
I need a candygram and a feedtrough

48
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,639
that'll burrow through
any firewall ever built.

49
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:53,558
Things are gettin' exciting.

50
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,227
And how about a waterwitch?

51
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,980
No, but I do have...

52
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,107
A Ragemaster?

53
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,192
That's NSA grade.

54
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,861
Serious hard-on when that showed up.

55
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,490
Yeah. I know what you mean.

56
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:12,328
Is all of this equipment illegal?

57
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:17,749
Well, with this kind of technology,
legality is a bit of a moving target.

58
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,837
- Ah.
- I figure justice is as justice does.

59
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,006
If the government
can use this shit to spy on us,

60
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,925
why shouldn't we be able to spy on them?

61
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,886
Missed you, buddy.

62
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:35,642
I married my husband
when I was 22 years old.

63
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:41,524
I felt like I was a very lucky woman.

64
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,693
Then he lost his job.

65
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,031
And he started drinking.

66
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,993
And then... beating me.

67
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:59,833
I could guess how bad the beating would be
by the hands of the clock.

68
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,420
Time was a source of terror.

69
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:11,220
But in here, every moment
spent free of that man is a gift.

70
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:17,184
But... why are you here?

71
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:22,647
Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap
and killed the motherfucker.

72
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,360
She did her husband, too.

73
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,197
He was a bad man.

74
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,992
And you?

75
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:38,205
I pushed my father's wheelchair
down an elevator shaft,

76
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,165
with him still in it.

77
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,839
In this country, sometimes the only place
you can find a brave and honest woman

78
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,174
is in prison.

79
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,684
You guys have been so good to me.

80
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,686
I just want to do something for you.

81
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,273
Hernando, I know you've been dying
to come to this restaurant

82
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,609
ever since Lito talked about the food.

83
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,195
I saw you and your little
emoticon sad face.

84
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,239
Hm?

85
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:18,412
But here you are... out in the world,
sitting next to each other.

86
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,667
Come on! Let's enjoy it.

87
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,960
This is not working, Daniela.

88
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,753
We went to the wrestling thing together.

89
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,713
- It's different.
- Why?

90
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:32,676
Because that was a guy thing,
and this is a romantic restaurant?

91
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,136
Exactly.

92
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,933
You worry too much.

93
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,478
This is totally working.

94
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:45,230
If a photographer comes up
or someone that wants an autograph,

95
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:48,400
all Hernando has to do
is stand up and glower at them,

96
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,195
and I guarantee everyone in this room
will believe he's your new bodyguard.

97
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,782
- I... I can glower. I... I can do that.
- See?

98
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,917
Hi. Um... can we take a picture?

99
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,212
I'm sorry, Mr. Rodriguez is busy.

100
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:11,965
- It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
- Oh... Oh, OK.

101
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,635
Thank you. Hi.

102
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,475
- OK.
- Thank you very much.

103
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:27,356
- We have to go.
- This is my fault.

104
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,773
- It was my fault.
- It isn't your fault.

105
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:30,693
- Relax.
- Let's go, please.

106
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:37,199
The man is eating. Leave him in peace, OK?
Leave him in peace!

107
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,626
Oh, my God!

108
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,420
- How was it?
- So good!

109
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,506
I... I believed it.

110
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,508
I mean, I fully believed it.

111
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,177
I believed it, too.

112
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,866
Oh, my God.

113
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,035
Clouds!

114
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:24,829
Look at them! So close.

115
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,124
Beautiful.

116
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,128
How amazing is this, huh?

117
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:35,006
I've never been on a plane.

118
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, you are so lucky.

119
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,719
No, I'm not lucky.

120
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:42,931
Of course you are.
You are flying, above clouds.

121
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:46,017
Privileged, not lucky.

122
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,146
You are lucky 'cause you are
still able to see your father.

123
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:56,111
That is something I dream about,
but will never happen again.

124
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,739
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,116
It's OK.

126
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,287
I lost my father,
but I still have my mother.

127
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,916
I wish I could see the world that simply.

128
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:13,920
Riley, look out of the window.

129
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:17,006
Those are actual clouds.

130
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:25,140
But what if something terrible happens
because of me going back?

131
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:30,771
What if something wonderful happens? Eh?

132
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,485
First class, huh? It's nice.

133
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,552
I love you.

134
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:10,059
Mr. Gonzalez! How are you doing?

135
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:14,105
My new bodyguard, Hernando.
My girlfriend, Daniela.

136
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,192
You'll be seeing a lot of them.

137
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:08,201
Hi, Pop.

138
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:14,416
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

139
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,712
Thank you.

140
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:29,598
OK, OK, you have to admit
that was the best night out of your lives.

141
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:33,059
This, this was our first night out ever.

142
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,436
Ever.

143
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,147
- Champagne. Orange juice.
- Welcome home!

144
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:42,819
- Make you a drink?
- What the fuck are you doing here?

145
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:45,488
"The fuck"?

146
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:49,785
The fuck is the reason that I'm here.

147
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,036
Lito, call the police.

148
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,831
Hey!

149
00:13:55,582 --> 00:14:00,629
I know I'm the bad guy,
that's why I wore this mask.

150
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,006
But this is not the real me.

151
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,716
Shh.

152
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,390
See?

153
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,727
I'm not the bad guy.

154
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,564
I'm the sad guy.

155
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:25,153
- You're drunk.
- You're gonna have to leave, Joaquin.

156
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:29,407
Enter the hero. The big hero.

157
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,831
The man every guy wants to be
and every girl wants to fuck.

158
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't touch him.

159
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:41,920
Oh. Who's the tough guy? Huh?

160
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,798
He's my bodyguard, Joaquin. So, please.

161
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,258
He just broke a photographer's arm.

162
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,678
There's been enough violence for tonight.

163
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,347
That's cool. Cool, cool.

164
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,307
No violence.

165
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,060
I don't want no violence.

166
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,228
What do you want, Joaquin?

167
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:06,402
I wanna know what I did wrong
and what he did right, that's all.

168
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:09,781
For starters... Lito's never hit me.

169
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,367
Wait, that's not fair.

170
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,619
This is Mexico. I am a man.

171
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,579
I was raised that way.

172
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:20,166
You hit your woman
to make her respect you. Fuck!

173
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,003
Well, Lito's twice the man you'll ever be!

174
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:27,883
I know.

175
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:35,473
Oh, fuck. I know.

176
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:37,642
That's why I'm here.

177
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,769
Why?

178
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:44,190
Because I want to see it for myself.

179
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:47,151
Wanna be a better footballer,
watch the best.

180
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:52,115
Wanna be a better baller...
do the same.

181
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,533
What?

182
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,376
I wanna see you fuck her, Lito.

183
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,627
Jesus Christ!

184
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:09,549
I know how it sounds, but please!

185
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,885
Give the guy a break.

186
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:14,137
You're the better man. You won.

187
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,639
You fucked her away from me.

188
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:22,353
So I just thought maybe I could
learn how to fuck her back,

189
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:26,649
or at least how to fuck the next her
away from someone else.

190
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:30,361
- That's it. I'm calling the police.
- Oh, no, no. Please. No, wait! Hey!

191
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:32,989
Listen to me. Wait, Dani. Listen to me.

192
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:38,244
Leave it! Leave it!
Get the fuck out of here!

193
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:41,831
- That's it.
- I don't want to go.

194
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
Please. OK, I'm going. I'm going.

195
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,755
Lito, fuck her in good health!

196
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,599
My bodyguard.

197
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:04,854
I'm feeling very
Whitney Houston right now.

198
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,868
Amanita never told me
she was dating Robin Hood.

199
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:22,413
Nom's got this whole secret identity, Mom.

200
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:26,250
Silicon Valley nerd by day,
political hacktivist by night.

201
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:29,253
- She tried to go straight...
- Hey, I would never go straight.

202
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:33,591
She tried to play by the rules,
and they tried to lobotomize her.

203
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:40,515
I'm sensing a bit of a negative vibe here.
You guys picking up on this?

204
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,601
Your Spidey sense tingling
or something, 5-0?

205
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:46,604
Maybe this wasn't
the most prudent decision.

206
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,648
- We'll be all right.
- Y'all just need to be cool

207
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,899
and let me do the talkin', a'ight?

208
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:53,361
You know, I still can't believe
how you're just taking this all in stride.

209
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:57,073
If someone told me they were hearing
other people's voices in their heads,

210
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,450
I'd be sure they slipped off
their medication.

211
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,994
Child of the '60s.

212
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,122
If you didn't hear voices at least once,
you were doing something wrong.

213
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:06,041
You sure you got the right kid?

214
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,626
- I never seen him with your crew.
- That's the point. He's an eye.

215
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,462
You're not supposed to see him,
but he sees you.

216
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:14,174
Like the man says,
when you look into the ghetto...

217
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,968
the ghetto looks back at you.

218
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:21,305
There was a time when people
who heard voices were considered saints.

219
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,184
It wasn't a sign of madness,
it was a sign of the miraculous.

220
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,353
Still is, as far as I'm concerned.

221
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:31,858
Oh, yeah!

222
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,861
- Game time! You niggas are sweet!
- Yeah!

223
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,113
Yeah!

224
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:51,669
Oh, shit.

225
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:54,756
Ludicrous Lincoln. Fuck me.

226
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,718
Why'd it have to be Lincoln?

227
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,441
You and Lincoln got history or somethin'?

228
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:05,016
My boy got all Romeo
with the former Ms. Ludicrous.

229
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,768
Damn, Will!

230
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,730
When Nita was very young,

231
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:14,943
I took her to her first July 4th picnic,
and she got scared by the fireworks.

232
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,653
Still hate 'em.
Why celebrate with symbols of war?

233
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:21,032
- Wars are always a failure.
- Yes, honey.

234
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:24,327
But she got frightened,
and before I knew it, she was gone.

235
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,538
Lost. A million people around me.

236
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:31,500
I felt this panic starting to rise up,
but before it hit,

237
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,796
I suddenly could hear her.

238
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,005
Not her voice.

239
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:40,384
It was the sound that she used to make
when she slept against my chest.

240
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:46,266
- Aw.
- It was a... a feeling, or a vibration,

241
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:48,851
and I... I followed it straight to her.

242
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,436
Waffle cone stand.

243
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,814
I'm a simple girl.

244
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:56,901
No one believed me when I told them
how I found her, but it didn't matter.

245
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:58,278
I knew what had happened.

246
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:01,405
I'm one of those people
who's comfortable with the idea

247
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,784
that there's more going on in this world
that we don't understand

248
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,535
than all the things that we do.

249
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:11,040
Hey, you know I'm askin' myself,
can this be that Officer Gorski?

250
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:16,921
The very same Officer Gorski
that tried to stick his pork

251
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,631
- into my motherfuckin' pussy?
- OK...

252
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:20,925
- Shut the fuck up, Officer Gorski!
- Back the fuck up.

253
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,970
Uh-uh. Nah, man. Ludicrous,
you gave me your word that you...

254
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,805
Word don't mean shit to this punk.

255
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:28,224
Let's all remember that
he has somethin' you want,

256
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,934
you got somethin' he want.
C'mon, man.

257
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,149
You know the fundamental
nature of the universe

258
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,318
is not competition, Officer Gorski.

259
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:41,363
No? What is it then?

260
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,115
Commerce.

261
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,702
Find anything new on Metzger?

262
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:51,206
Checking his travel records,
he has been all over the world.

263
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:54,876
London, Istanbul, Switzerland,
Seoul, and Iceland.

264
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,503
- Hm.
- And these are his insurance records,

265
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,881
basically his work history
over the past year.

266
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,217
You're looking for the operation
he was gonna do to you.

267
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,304
Exactly. He's performed it three times
in the Bay area.

268
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:08,139
What happened to the patients?

269
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,934
Two of them died.

270
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:15,230
And the third?

271
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,689
What is it you want?

272
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,816
- Diplomatic immunity.
- What?

273
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,526
We want you to leave us the fuck alone.

274
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:24,030
That includes your motherfuckin' pork.

275
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:26,074
Fuck this shit.
How about we haul you in right now

276
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:29,369
- for obstructing a federal investigation?
- Nobody's arresting anybody.

277
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,705
If the information is good...

278
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:38,502
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Niles Bolger.

279
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,755
- He's a patient here.
- And you are?

280
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:42,048
I'm his niece.

281
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,765
4K, show him.

282
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,144
All right.

283
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:59,065
- You saw the van pull up?
- I knew somethin' was up.

284
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,566
Smelled like the Feds.

285
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:03,403
- They pull anything out of the building?
- Check it.

286
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,490
Who's in the bag?

287
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,325
Still unidentified at this point.

288
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:13,329
- You get the license plates?
- Of course I got the plates.

289
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:15,173
What you think we are,
amateur hour and shit?

290
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,086
I'll start a trace.

291
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,382
Oh, yeah. Scary dude.

292
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,760
The way he talked and everybody jumped,
figured he was the big dog.

293
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:29,929
Hey, you know this dude, 5-0?

294
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:52,327
The procedure was performed
by Dr. Metzger, right?

295
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,205
Yes, Dr. Metzger
personally handled Mr. Bolger.

296
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,176
Uncle Niles, it's me, Nomi.

297
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,943
No... Thank you.

298
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:29,447
Nom!

299
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:38,789
Wha...?

300
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:45,380
That could be me.

301
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:47,631
It's not. You're here.

302
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:50,426
Just promise me that no matter
what you have to do,

303
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,636
you will not let that happen to me.

304
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,599
Promise?

305
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:00,144
I promise.

306
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:15,826
I'm just saying that if our equipment
was used in some sort of criminal act,

307
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,454
- clearly, we're not responsible.
- Clearly.

308
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:21,374
- We'll need to know who rented this.
- Paperwork's in the back office,

309
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:23,543
but without some sort of
warrant or something...

310
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,169
The warrant's gonna go to your bosses.

311
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:28,047
Probably have to file with corporate, too?
Just to be thorough.

312
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,049
- Yeah.
- Trust me, man, you do not want that.

313
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:32,134
I'll make a copy. Here it is.

314
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,136
Can you open it, please?

315
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,640
They brought it back real clean.
Most thorough clean-up job I've ever seen.

316
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,767
- Not a spot on it.
- I'll bet.

317
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:47,858
Hey, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

318
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,318
You OK?

319
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:52,738
No, I'm good.

320
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,083
From the day I decided to marry Rajan,

321
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:07,545
you have been sending me... visions.

322
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:12,675
You sent me a vision of a woman
taking her own life.

323
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:17,721
Visions of other people in distant places,
even in prison,

324
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:20,182
which could perhaps be a metaphor
for my situation,

325
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,768
intended for education and instruction.

326
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:28,983
But then, you sent me a vision of a man...

327
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:31,902
with a large...

328
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,158
trunk?

329
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:41,912
A very large trunk.

330
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:46,208
I am a little more than confused.

331
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,173
But... I trust you, Ganesha.

332
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:56,969
So I know there must be some meaning
to all of this that I cannot see.

333
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:00,014
And I wish to see. I wish to understand.

334
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:04,686
So help me, Ganesha.

335
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:07,438
Help me see what it is I must do.

336
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,773
Gods don't give a shit about us.

337
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,779
I speak from experience.

338
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,037
- Why won't you just leave me alone?
- I tried.

339
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,997
Believe me, I try not to think of you,

340
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,082
but every time,
it brings me straight to you.

341
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,422
At least...

342
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:36,217
you're wearing clothes.

343
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:04,119
It's nice here.

344
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:08,123
The weather's shit in Berlin.

345
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:12,587
It rains like this in Bombay...

346
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,298
but it's not so cold there.

347
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:31,522
So tell me... does he ever help?

348
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:34,692
- What?
- Your god.

349
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:37,069
- Oh. Of course.
- How?

350
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:41,198
I asked him to stop my wedding,
and he did.

351
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:43,659
You think he stopped your wedding?

352
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:47,747
Do you have a better explanation?

353
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:53,335
So you think our connection...
is a kind of miracle?

354
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:59,508
If I were trying to describe
this feeling...

355
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:04,806
the sensation of experiencing
the warmth of the sun,

356
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:07,015
the smell of jasmine and marigold...

357
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:14,356
while at the same time being soaked
by a downpour at an outdoor café...

358
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:28,329
the taste of strong coffee
still in my mouth...

359
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:36,712
I would say that the word "miracle"
sounds particularly appropriate.

360
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,466
Wouldn't you?

361
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,834
You slept well?

362
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:19,380
Best sleep I had in a long time.

363
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,728
- I made pancakes.
- Yeah?

364
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,716
That boy is one of them.

365
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,552
He's from Jaluo, the same as his father.

366
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:07,803
His father is dead.

367
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,849
Wh... Where do you want us to go?
Where can we go?

368
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,141
Send him back then.

369
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,310
But he's my son.

370
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,479
He belongs with his own people.

371
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:20,566
It is best for everyone.

372
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:29,784
- Shiro! Please don't do this.
- Let her go.

373
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,577
God damn you.

374
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,580
God damn your tribes and your bad blood!

375
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:37,082
You can all go to hell.

376
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:50,805
During your time of stay, you will
complete female vocational training.

377
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,767
Can you sew, Prisoner 773?

378
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,645
- No.
- Did your mother neglect you?

379
00:30:58,562 --> 00:31:01,398
- My mother died.
- Oh.

380
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,403
You are very lucky, 773.

381
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,071
Here, you'll receive training.

382
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:09,740
Who will be her teacher?

383
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,575
Volunteer?

384
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:16,497
Or I will assign one.

385
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,165
Pardon, ma'am.

386
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,127
I will be her teacher.

387
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,923
773, move to this table.

388
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:32,220
- You know the rules.
- Yes, thank you.

389
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,398
You didn't have to help me.

390
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:45,651
I know.

391
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,863
Smells so good, Papa.

392
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:54,827
- You're not having one?
- No, I ate hours ago.

393
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,622
I wanted you to wake up smelling them,
but you must have been really tired.

394
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,585
I've been watching you on the Internet.

395
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:06,171
- You've had a lot of shows. Doing well.
- Mm.

396
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:10,425
Oh, it's nothing, just playing records
for drunk people trying to get laid.

397
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,135
Playing Beethoven's the same, you know.

398
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:15,723
The people are mostly too old and tired
to bother with the getting laid part.

399
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,143
You make music, Riley,

400
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:23,939
and for a moment,
people forget the troubles in their lives.

401
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,984
It's no small thing.
I'm very proud of you.

402
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,277
Thanks, Papa.

403
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,613
I have to get to rehearsal.

404
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:36,994
If you need to go out, Sven is next door,
and he can drive you anywhere.

405
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,704
I thought he would be out on his boat.

406
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:40,664
He heard you were coming,
dropped everything.

407
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,210
I told Sven I don't care
if anybody shows up tomorrow,

408
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:46,670
as long as my daughter's there.

409
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,719
I'll see you, honey. Bye-bye.

410
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:55,930
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Papa.

411
00:33:00,517 --> 00:33:03,311
You should not have come back.

412
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,782
I was always afraid as a child.

413
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:20,203
I couldn't sleep if the light was off
or if it was too quiet.

414
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,914
I don't like the quiet.

415
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,293
I used to fall asleep
in my father's restaurant.

416
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,635
I've always hated being alone.

417
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,307
It's one of the reasons
why I love the festival.

418
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,547
Mommy!

419
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:14,257
Papa!

420
00:34:18,637 --> 00:34:20,014
Mommy!

421
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:21,306
Papa!

422
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,851
Come! This way! Come!

423
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:40,075
- Do you like this? Come on, here!
- Yes!

424
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,917
Do you want to see what he sees?

425
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,669
What who sees?

426
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,587
Ganesha.

427
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,258
Come, come.

428
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,726
Look there!

429
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,225
It made me a believer.

430
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:50,020
But you're a scientist.

431
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,230
I am.

432
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:56,610
My love for science
doesn't preclude my faith.

433
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:58,946
For me, science is another language we use

434
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:02,741
to talk about the same miracles
that faith talks about.

435
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:08,747
But... one language makes sense,
one doesn't.

436
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:14,169
Sense? What, like quantum physics?

437
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:17,756
Like a particle
that can be here and not here?

438
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,467
Or sense like gravity?

439
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:25,513
A force that no one knows why exists.

440
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:30,978
Only that if it didn't exist...

441
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:39,236
if there wasn't this
mysterious attraction...

442
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:45,826
this pull between objects...

443
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:52,374
then none of this would exist either.

444
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,461
Thank God for gravity.

445
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,089
Exactly.

446
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:03,844
Hey, Wolfie. Where the fuck are you?

447
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:05,387
What?

448
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:11,101
- I heard from Abraham.
- And?

449
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,980
He'll take the rest of the diamonds.

450
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:16,481
When?

451
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:19,442
I don't know,
but we're going to be fucking rich!

452
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,323
- Hey! This is great fucking news!
- It is.

453
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:27,784
So why do you look like
someone took a piss in your beer?

454
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:32,247
I've been thinking I want to
get out of Berlin for a little while.

455
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:35,334
- Oh.
- I need to take a trip.

456
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,501
Where?

457
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:40,505
India.

458
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:49,181
No, go around to the other side,
or the thread will break again.

459
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,105
Ssst! She's coming.

460
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,456
See you outside, bitch.

461
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:17,418
Or not.

462
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,261
Does this happen often?

463
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:30,805
Only when the sun is out.

464
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:42,317
Don't get into any trouble, Diana Prince.

465
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:44,903
Mr. Kabaka wants to see you.

466
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,447
Dad's here?

467
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,827
Dad, you came to pick me up!

468
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:55,914
How could I leave you alone
on your birthday?

469
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:57,665
I know you're just pretending to forget.

470
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,335
Happy birthday. You could have told me.

471
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,254
You know I like my secrets.

472
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,465
She is like her father.

473
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:07,217
And now, I have a little surprise for you.

474
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,344
Come with us.

- 'Morning, Whitney.
- Good morning.

480
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:33,034
- What time's call?
- Ten minutes.

481
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:35,370
Oh, so you're already late.

482
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:39,749
- Would you like to be a lot late?
- Why?

483
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,168
Why?

484
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,297
Who calls?

485
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,635
This is what our relationship has come to?

486
00:39:50,718 --> 00:39:52,929
Texting me from inside of the house?

487
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:56,558
I didn't text you.

488
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,435
Fuck.

489
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,395
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

490
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,524
Tell me this is a joke.

491
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,069
Oh, my God.

492
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:11,198
The son of a bitch
must have stole my phone.

493
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:14,951
- You took pictures of us?
- You took pictures of us having sex?

494
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:21,416
This could destroy my career,
my whole life.

495
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,626
I'm... I'm so sorry.

496
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:33,428
He could blackmail me.

497
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:36,181
- He's gonna blackmail me.
- No, no. No, no. I...

498
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:39,226
- We'll figure this out.
- No, I'm gonna talk to him.

499
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,144
I'll get the phone,
the pictures, everything.

500
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:44,481
It's my fault, and I'm gonna fix it.
I'm... I'm gonna fix it.

501
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,991
Fuck!

502
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:00,288
You sure Metzger's gonna be here?

503
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:02,707
Reimbursement receipts show
he comes in for a coffee

504
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,251
every day around this time.

505
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:05,793
We are creatures of habit.

506
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:12,593
Enter the creature.

507
00:41:13,176 --> 00:41:14,969
Large non-fat latte.

508
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:16,679
Right on time.

509
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:23,103
What does that thing do again?

510
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:27,065
It uses its own network to clone the phone
that he's using with this one.

511
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:29,422
What if he doesn't check his e-mail?

512
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:31,903
Ever not checked your e-mail
while waiting for a coffee?

513
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:35,740
Ooh!

514
00:41:36,408 --> 00:41:40,787
I'm in. Downloading contacts,
e-mails, calls, passwords.

515
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,873
Mm. You are kinda like
Robin Hood, aren't you?

516
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,470
What's he doing?

517
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,098
What?

518
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,566
He looked scared.

519
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,111
Makes you wonder who was
on the other end of that call.

520
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:16,864
Contact list shows "Dr. Matheson."

521
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,325
I know what you're thinking.

522
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:21,328
I know that look.
Don't. Don't do it, Robin.

523
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,667
Don't, don't, don't...

524
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,670
I thought we were clear.

525
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:32,422
Who is this?

526
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,048
Is this Nomi?

527
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:35,132
What?

528
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:37,719
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

529
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:40,221
What? Who was it?

530
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:43,016
I don't know, but he knew me.

531
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:45,852
Shit.

532
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:49,523
Metzger's booked
on the last flight to Chicago.

533
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:52,275
OK, what does that mean?

534
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,154
- He's not gonna be in his house tonight.
- You're crazy, you know that?

535
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:58,281
I have to get into his home network.

536
00:42:58,365 --> 00:42:59,741
If these people know who I am,

537
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:02,285
then we need to start
figuring out who they are.

538
00:43:05,622 --> 00:43:07,541
W-W-N-Double-D.

539
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,918
What would Nancy Drew do?

540
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,962
I sense a costume opportunity.

541
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,687
They're all yours.

542
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:40,865
She likes you.

543
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,493
She has a big heart.

544
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:46,079
I would do anything for her.

545
00:43:49,832 --> 00:43:52,126
It's the same with you
and your mother, yes?

546
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:56,130
Come with me.

547
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,305
This love... my enemies
would call a weakness,

548
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:06,015
something to be exploited.

549
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:08,309
I disagree.

550
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:11,730
I mean, these men,
what do they hold in their hearts, huh?

551
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:16,484
Desire... lust... greed.

552
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:23,408
But I ask... are these men willing to go
as far as you and I for what they believe?

553
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:27,995
This one...

554
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:34,127
This one I was grooming
to be my number one runner.

555
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:36,755
Do you know what he did?

556
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:43,970
He watered down the drugs I gave him
so he could double-up on the money.

557
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:48,767
My reputation is only as good
as the products I sell.

558
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,228
Mr. Kabaka, I...

559
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:54,939
Am I willing
to let my business perish,

560
00:44:55,022 --> 00:45:00,153
to let the life I've made for my daughter
be destroyed by greed and stupidity?

561
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:16,252
He understood the risk he was taking.

562
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,349
Wow, it worked!

563
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:31,309
You read that in a book?

564
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:33,561
The power of literature.

565
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,892
Amazing. Do you know what else
I read in a Lee Child book?

566
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:46,991
That you can use the crowbar as an alarm.

567
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,828
So if anyone pushes the door,
we'll hear it.

568
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:51,621
We make such a good team.

569
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:55,750
Maybe Bug's right and we should become
a crime-fighting dynamic duo.

570
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,293
I think we already are.

571
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:11,973
Wow.

572
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:18,981
- Zombie-making sure does pay well.
- Yeah.

573
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,612
This is really weird.
There's almost nothing personal.

574
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:28,991
This guy's about as interesting
as a mouthful of sawdust.

575
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:31,160
He doesn't even have
any porn stashed away.

576
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:34,163
No porn? He is weird.

577
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:38,376
Oh, my God! Nom!

578
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:40,503
BFF's with Cheney.

579
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:43,548
He's gotta be evil.

580
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:50,555
Uh-oh.

581
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,851
He can't be all bad.

582
00:46:57,812 --> 00:46:59,564
OK, just a couple more minutes,

583
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,327
and I'll have the entire
hard drive copied.

584
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,111
Come, come, come.

585
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:06,195
What's wrong?

586
00:47:09,323 --> 00:47:10,617
Hey.

587
00:47:11,409 --> 00:47:13,745
- What happened?
- I don't know what happened.

588
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:15,789
Nothing happened.

589
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,540
It's the nothing that has me worried.

590
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:19,375
You went to see Abraham?

591
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,921
I did. Or at least I tried to.

592
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:25,339
- We had a date.
- He didn't show?

593
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:28,509
No. So I called. Nothing.

594
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,139
Went by his shop. Closed up. Gone.

595
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:35,391
Fuck!

596
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:40,939
I'm thinking about your passage to India.
Maybe you need a Sherpa or something?

597
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:46,152
- Hello?
- We're closed!

598
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:48,488
Please, please, can you help me?

599
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:56,704
Oh, what would all the damsels do
if I left the city, huh?

600
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:56,014
Oh, my God, Nom!

601
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:04,689
Hello?

602
00:49:05,398 --> 00:49:07,441
Shit! It's Metzger.

603
00:49:07,525 --> 00:49:08,943
I'm calling the police.

604
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:10,611
It's not done. It's not done yet.

605
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:13,948
You better get out of here
before they arrive.

606
00:49:18,786 --> 00:49:19,787
Nomi.

607
00:49:20,788 --> 00:49:22,582
Hi, Dr. Metzger.

608
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:25,707
Whatever brought you here,

609
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:29,964
I'm happy to see that you had a...
moment of sufficient clarity

610
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:33,676
to seek me out to get the treatment
that you... need.

611
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,361
It shows there's still time to help you.

612
00:49:35,428 --> 00:49:37,764
I can have an ambulance here
in five minutes.

613
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:40,266
I'm not the one that's
gonna need an ambulance.

614
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:43,185
Go ahead, doc, make my day.

615
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:45,063
You must be Amanita.

616
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:49,233
What I am, doc, is your worst nightmare,
unless you put that phone down.

617
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:51,444
You both are in a lot of trouble.

618
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:53,446
Yeah, well you're about to get
an eyeful of Mace

619
00:49:53,613 --> 00:49:55,406
if you don't start answering my questions.

620
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:58,076
We visited your little zombie prison
in Nightingale's.

621
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,453
Yes... I know.

622
00:50:00,536 --> 00:50:03,164
I'm guessing that's the reason
my trip was canceled.

623
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:04,791
Who canceled it?

624
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:06,250
Was it Dr. Matheson?

625
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:11,380
How do you know that name?

626
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:13,133
She jacked your phone.

627
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:16,803
I called him. We had a little chat.

628
00:50:16,886 --> 00:50:19,806
- Oh, no.
- Who is he, doc?

629
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:23,017
What have you done?

630
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:24,685
Nomi.

631
00:50:25,478 --> 00:50:27,438
- Jonas?
- You've gotta get out of here.

632
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:28,982
- Jonas?
- Why?

633
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:31,151
- He's coming.
- Is that Jonas Maliki?

634
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:34,195
- Who?
- Whispers.

635
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,490
- Who is Whispers?
- Oh, my God, you've killed us all.

636
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:42,369
He's here.

637
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:48,292
Niles?

638
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,178
Nomi!

639
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,304
- Come on! Nom!
- Wait, wait, wait!

640
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:01,931
Please, come on! Leave it!

641
00:51:12,608 --> 00:51:15,611
- Help! Somebody help! Somebody!
- Help!

642
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:17,155
Somebody help!

643
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:19,073
- Help!
- Help!

644
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:20,200
Please!

645
00:51:20,282 --> 00:51:22,743
Help us! Help us, please!

646
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:23,911
Hey doc, what's going on?

647
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:45,266
Please! No. No! No!

648
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:46,433
No! No!
