3
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:13,964
(no audible dialogue)

4
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,884
- I was just...
- ...thinking about you.

5
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:13,816
Cheers.

6
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,193
Cheers.

7
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,204
I'm Riley, by the way.

8
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:29,373
I'm Will.

9
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,378
You're a cop?

10
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:39,216
You're a musician?

11
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,385
No. Just a DJ.

12
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:44,429
That's-- That's cool.

13
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:49,226
- You live in Chicago?
- Yeah.

14
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,063
You're in, uh... London, right?

15
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:55,191
Ah, that's so cool.
I've always wanted to go.

16
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:57,442
Well, here you are.

17
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,404
Yeah, but...

18
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,740
I know.

19
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,409
Are we going crazy?

20
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,997
I got an idea.

21
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,082
Give me your phone.

22
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:20,090
All right, now, there's no way
you could know this number, right?

23
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,844
So when you hit this button...

24
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,264
that phone shouldn't ring, right?

25
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,767
OK. Call me.

26
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:41,737
(phone ringing)

27
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,535
Hey, Diego!

28
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,999
- Hey, Diego.
- What's up?

29
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,877
There's something going on with
my hearing. Can you pick this up for me?

30
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,003
Yeah.

31
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,260
- Hello?
- Uh, hi. Is Will there?

32
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,429
Yeah. Hang on.

33
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:10,140
- Some chick with a weird accent.
- Weird accent?

34
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:13,102
- She sounds hot.
- I like him.

35
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,104
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

36
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,692
- Safe to say we're not going crazy.
- (over phone) <i>...not going crazy.</i>

37
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:24,154
- Oh, my God. This is so cool.
- (over phone) <i>This is so cool.</i>

38
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,912
Have you had any other visitors?

39
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,957
Jonas said that there were eight of us.

40
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,166
Jonas?

41
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,877
He was with the woman who shot herself.

42
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,588
Angelica.

43
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,006
How did you know that?

44
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,967
I'm not sure.

45
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:52,349
That... That time you came to the church,
you seemed really scared.

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,644
Like something happened.

47
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,147
You OK?

48
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,108
I-- I am sorry.

49
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,651
It's none of my business, I get it.

50
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:06,780
I have complicated friends.

51
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,158
Hey, tell me about it.

52
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,410
I should probably go to bed.

53
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:13,912
Yeah, well, must be
pretty late there, huh?

54
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,457
DJ hours.

55
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,639
(inaudible chatter)

56
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:27,611
They took it all, Neets.
My laptop, back-ups...

57
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,197
Oh, my God.

58
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,869
They even took all of my journals.

59
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,550
This isn't fair.

60
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:55,889
- None of this is fair.
- No, it's not.

61
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,727
- I didn't do anything.
- I know, sweetie.

62
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,150
This isn't gonna stop. They're never
gonna leave us alone, are they?

63
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,072
Unless we make them.

64
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:14,199
Uh-oh.

65
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:16,201
You got that look in your eye.

66
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,036
Fuck these guys, Neets.

67
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,164
We'll need a place.

68
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:23,750
Someone who can keep a secret,
someone we can trust.

69
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:28,171
Shit just got real.

70
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,967
- (clamoring)
- (reporters) Ms. Bak! Ms. Bak!

71
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,387
(overlapping chatter)

72
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:42,018
(reporter) How long ago
did you start embezzling?

73
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,439
Do you regret what you did?

74
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:48,150
For my actions taken...

75
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:53,155
<i>to embezzle funds from this firm,</i>

76
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:57,576
I have offered to surrender to police,
pending trial.

77
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,704
I acted alone in this.

78
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:05,292
Neither my father, my brother,
nor any other member of my family

79
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,794
were involved or profited in any way.

80
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:12,841
That's all I have to say.

81
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:15,678
(clamoring resumes)

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,055
How long ago did you start embezzling?
How could you spend that much...

83
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,896
(sniffing)

84
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:31,026
Riley.

85
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,082
Shugs?

86
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,879
(softly)
Why don't you take Bambie for a walk?

87
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,340
(sniffs)

88
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:11,107
(sighs) Sorry.

89
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:21,159
(door closes)

90
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:28,917
(softly) Riley, Riley, Riley, Riley...

91
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,890
Where is it?

92
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,186
The money.

93
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,982
I don't have it. I gave it away.

94
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,530
'Course you did.

95
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:01,241
'Course you did.

96
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,669
Look at my face, Riley.
Look at my face.

97
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,463
Look what they did to me.

98
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:30,270
This is nothing compared
to what I will do to you.

99
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,775
The money and the drugs...

100
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,029
or you die right now.

101
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,368
I swear I don't have them.

102
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,997
I threw them away.

103
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,416
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

104
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,086
I'm so sorry, Riley.

105
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:59,424
I don't believe you.

106
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:00,967
No, no, no, no.

107
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,386
Please, Nyx. I promise you--

108
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:07,349
- (glass shatters)
- (gasps)

109
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:10,727
(screams) Please, someone help!

110
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,522
Somebody help me! Oh!

111
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:17,776
(gasps)

112
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:30,497
(gasps, panting)

113
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,714
I hate violence.

114
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:43,051
But sometimes, violence is necessary.

115
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:46,555
Violence changes things.

116
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:50,433
(sobs, gasps)

117
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:02,946
I love how violence
can change something

118
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,867
as simple and ubiquitous...

119
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,161
as a plastic bag here,

120
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:15,458
into one of the most terrifying objects
in the world.

121
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,628
(screams)

122
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,550
(gasps)

123
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,969
Riley...

124
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:32,100
Let's see if this experience...
has changed your answer.

125
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:36,062
Riley, Riley...

126
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,899
Where's my money?

127
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,317
(sobs) I don't know.

128
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,780
(whispers) No, please.

129
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,366
I don't know.

130
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,702
(sobbing) No!

131
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:55,373
(screams, gasps)

132
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,797
(gasps)

133
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:13,308
(no audio)

134
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:23,276
(grunts)

135
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,323
- (bones crack)
- (screams)

136
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,830
(groans)

137
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,886
(coughing, gasping)

138
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,481
(gasping)

139
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,910
(indistinct murmurs)

140
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,710
(panting)

141
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,772
(doorbell rings)

142
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,068
Hey, Mom.

143
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,862
I am so glad you called.

144
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,363
Baby.

145
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,531
(kisses)

146
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,838
(relieved sighs)

147
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,466
Hi?

148
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,012
We decided it might be wise
to keep a watch on you.

149
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:19,183
We all watched, all night,
but very quietly.

150
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,061
Huh.

151
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:26,066
Thank you, but I'm fine, I think.

152
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,237
You must understand,
when you went over like that so suddenly,

153
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,782
we were terrified
something has happened to you.

154
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:38,369
Nothing matters to us
more than your well-being.

155
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,998
Thank you, but I'm fine, really.

156
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:43,833
You're sure?

157
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,628
Yeah. Why?

158
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:50,090
Rajan is waiting here downstairs.

159
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,637
(moans)

160
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,640
(floorboards creaking)

161
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:24,833
Hello, again.

162
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,002
Oh, no.

163
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,879
No, no.

164
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,548
Oh, no.

165
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,426
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

166
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,893
You have already ruined my life.

167
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,478
I didn't ruin anything.

168
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,023
You didn't want to marry that guy.

169
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,274
That is not for you to say.

170
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:53,153
Maybe not, but you wanted me to say it.

171
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,780
You don't know what I want.

172
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,324
Don't I?

173
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:03,913
No.

174
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:10,879
OK, I don't know what is going on here,
if-- if I am totally losing my mind,

175
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:16,634
or if one of the gods or goddesses
is angry with me and has sent a demon.

176
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:21,347
A dangerous pervert demon
who never seems to have any clothes on.

177
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,393
- Germans are not so uptight about nudity.
- Mm.

178
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,312
This is not about nudity, OK?
This is-- This is about decency.

179
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:30,815
It is about privacy.

180
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,485
If you were so concerned with privacy
and decency, why did you look?

181
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,113
I did not.

182
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,074
Yes, you did.

183
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,659
You looked then and you're looking now.

184
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:44,662
(sighs) I'm not.

185
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:46,831
Listen...

186
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,667
I don't know what's
happening to us either,

187
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:53,296
but I do know that from the moment
I first saw you, I wanted you.

188
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:57,717
And somehow, I feel
that you want me, too.

189
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:03,389
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,893
You are a demon.

191
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:09,854
- (heavy metal music playing)
- (crowd cheering)

192
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,402
(whistles)

193
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:20,949
This is-- This is the Manichaean drama.
It's life and death, good and evil.

194
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,201
(crowd cheering)

195
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:26,037
<i>La parca negra</i> is a symbol.

196
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,039
He is the devil in our lives.

197
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,916
For some, he can represent the government,

198
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,168
the class system
or any form of oppression.

199
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:35,880
But for most of us,
he is that fear we're afraid to face.

200
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:37,340
Come on!

201
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:40,843
Come on!

202
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,806
You will discover that Hernando
thinks a lot about everything.

203
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,226
- That's what I love about him.
- I get it.

204
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,603
(crowd clamoring)

205
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,316
- You love this, don't you?
- Mm!

206
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:57,777
- I love art, all kinds of art.
- (laughs)

207
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,446
I mean, this is a dance
that is also a fight.

208
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:05,118
The struggle that takes place in the ring
is a reflection of the struggle

209
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:07,996
that takes place in our minds
and in our hearts.

210
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,291
At some point,
we all encounter our own<i> parca negra.</i>

211
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,210
He is that thing we are afraid of,

212
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:18,798
that thing that stops us from becoming
what we know we can become.

213
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:22,969
Until we defeat him,
we will never know peace.

214
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,929
Oh!

215
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,555
- Get him!
- Come on!

216
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,683
- (shouts in Spanish)
- Come on!

217
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:32,145
(crowd clamoring)

218
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,564
(crowd noise fades)

219
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,372
Mm.

220
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:53,541
Your father's patra ni machhi
is a gift to my mouth.

221
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:56,711
Every taste bud
is dancing and singing his praise.

222
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:00,840
It's his grandmother's recipe.

223
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,466
Mm.

224
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,637
Amazing. Absolutely amazing to me
how lives can span generations

225
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:11,434
in something as simple as a recipe,
or something as complex as DNA.

226
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,480
By all accounts, great-grandmother
was a very difficult person,

227
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,025
who told my father he was a terrible cook,

228
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,486
and hated the way he made
the patra ni machhi.

229
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,280
Well, back then,
it must have been very hard

230
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:26,824
for a woman with her obvious talents.

231
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,492
Even today, she would have a hard time

232
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:32,621
getting the same recognition
your father gets just because he's a man.

233
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,833
Well, our parents do
the best that they can,

234
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,543
and it's our job to forgive them.

235
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:42,715
Rajan, you're not making this easy,
but I think we should just get on with it.

236
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,468
- Get on with what?
- I know why you came here.

237
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:49,097
I know that if it was you that had fainted
just before you were to marry me,

238
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,100
oh, dear, I'd be absolutely sure
that you hated me

239
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:53,935
and that you didn't
want anything to do with me.

240
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,853
- Kala, slow down.
- So I completely understand

241
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:58,356
if you came here because
you don't want to marry me any longer.

242
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,733
And you don't have to worry
about protecting my feelings--

243
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,651
Kala, please, just listen.

244
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:07,198
For me, what happened at the banquet
was a part of the story.

245
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,618
I'm here because I'm hoping
that it's not the end of our story.

246
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,955
For me, I love what happened.

247
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:16,707
I love it because it makes
our wedding something special.

248
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,794
Everyone else looks at pictures
of their wedding

249
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,670
and the story is always the same.

250
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,172
They have nothing to say.

251
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,758
But I imagine telling our children
how their beautiful mother

252
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:28,719
took one look at their father
and fainted straight away.

253
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:33,641
It is a great twist.

254
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,519
You can see why we have to
get married now, can't you?

255
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,796
(Silas) Van Damme.

256
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:06,257
I hear your mother continues to improve.

257
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:10,219
Yes. The medicine is helping.
Thank you.

258
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,930
There's no "thank you" necessary.

259
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:15,558
I'm not in the business of charity.

260
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:20,563
You're thinking,
"What will he have me deliver this time?

261
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:26,652
Drugs? Weapons? More coconuts?"
(chuckles)

262
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:38,122
- Amondi. How are you?
- I'm good.

263
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:39,790
I'd like you to meet someone.

264
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,252
- This is Capheus.
- Hi.

265
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,504
Hello.

266
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:48,299
Wow! What have you made, my dear?

267
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,719
- It's a home of the Little Mermaid.
- I love it.

268
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,597
This is the sort of place I wish I lived.

269
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,931
Me, too.

270
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:58,476
Why don't you get your camera,

271
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,979
so you can take a picture of it
and ask how much it'll cost to build?

272
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:04,524
- Really?
- It never hurts to ask.

273
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,619
My daughter, Amondi,
does not see me as someone to fear.

274
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,789
She sees me only as Papa.

275
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,836
(sighs)

276
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:28,881
She has leukemia.

277
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:34,512
To combat this, she receives
induction therapy, stem cell therapy,

278
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:39,016
at the World Health Organization Center
on the Nakuru Road. You know it?

279
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,644
My cars are known to my enemies.

280
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,313
The road to Nakuru is long.

281
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:47,442
No one would think to look for her
in that pile of shit you call a bus.

282
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,697
She's the most important thing
in the world to me, Capheus.

283
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:59,412
Everything I do
is to build a life for her.

284
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:03,707
Every breath I take,
I breathe for her.

285
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,335
Without her, my life has no meaning.

286
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:16,345
And if something happens to her...
neither will yours.

287
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,350
Prosecution submits the defendant
has violated 356 and 231

288
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:22,893
of the Korean penal code.

289
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:26,272
We also confirm the interrogation record,
signed by the defendant.

290
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:28,691
(man) Your Honor, my client
has signed the confession,

291
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,695
but wishes to pursue a jury trial
for purpose of latitude in sentencing.

292
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:37,741
In order to properly prepare our case,
we ask for the right to post bail.

293
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:43,414
- Does the prosecution object?
- Yes, we do, Your Honor.

294
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:47,751
Of the 30 billion won
the defendant stole from investors,

295
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,837
most remains unaccounted for.

296
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,090
It would be easy for someone with
Ms. Bak's connections to flee the country.

297
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:56,010
My client has a clean record,
and has willingly cooperated--

298
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,012
Only after the investigation began,
Your Honor,

299
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:00,723
when exposure became inevitable.

300
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:07,647
I concur. Bail is denied.

301
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,941
(gavel slams)

302
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,860
(crowd murmurs)

303
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,345
All I'm saying is... guys are talking.

304
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:40,846
What guys?

305
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,349
Just guys.

306
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,351
If someone's got a problem with me,
I should know.

307
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,144
It'll just piss you off.

308
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:49,689
All right. You know what?
I don't give a shit anyway.

309
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,357
That's your problem.

310
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:56,904
I saw Sobczak's eyes
after your exorcist act,

311
00:26:56,987 --> 00:27:00,700
and if I were you,
I'd start giving a shit.

312
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:06,372
And what about you?
You think I'm crazy?

313
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, yeah. But I like 'em crazy.

314
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:11,460
(laughs)

315
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:19,260
(overlapping chatter)

316
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,846
- (speaking Swahili)
- (overlapping chatter)

317
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,933
Wham-bam, there comes our man.

318
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,602
We are locked and loaded, partner!

319
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:28,977
Look at the Rat Van. (laughs)

320
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:31,188
Sinking ship. (mocking laugh)

321
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,648
(Capheus) Sorry, Jela.

322
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:34,776
- The Van Damn is taken today.
- What?

323
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:36,778
- Get these people off the bus.
- Are you crazy?

324
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,196
It is also taken for tomorrow
and the day after,

325
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,657
- chartered for private use.
- By who?

326
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,576
Silas Kabaka.

327
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,829
He paid a week in advance.

328
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:48,414
Here.

329
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,291
- You mustn't do this.
- I have to.

330
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:52,710
He can get medicine for my mother.

331
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,169
Real medicine I cannot afford.

332
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,215
Take the money, please.

333
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:02,052
(sighs)

334
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:14,607
Remove all clothing.

335
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,192
The shower is there.
You have two minutes.

336
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:22,824
You're shy.

337
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:24,867
There are no doors.

338
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:29,079
You gave up your right to privacy
the minute you arrived here.

339
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,512
We are on the location of
<i>Even Angels Must Earn Their Wings</i>

340
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:47,222
with its star, Lito Rodriquez.

341
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:54,104
So, Lito, can we get a little
up close and personal here?

342
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:56,732
Sexual history.

343
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:00,862
- Any STDs?
- No.

344
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:05,407
- Cold sores? Crabs? Lice?
- No.

345
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:08,202
Have you ever been checked for HIV?

346
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:14,375
Excuse me?

347
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,919
What about family?

348
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,171
What about them?

349
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:22,591
- Family is very important to me.
- Answer the question.

350
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:25,135
When was your last intercourse?

351
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,097
Some time ago.

352
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:32,768
Well, Lito, we don't have a lot of time,
so I'll have to be direct.

353
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:36,605
Stand up,
and remove your underwear.

354
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:44,112
And squat over... this mirror.

355
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:49,618
Hey, whoa, no, no, no. Hey.

356
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,495
I'm not doing that.

357
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,043
You're not doing what?

358
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,005
Oh, my God, Christina.

359
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:07,261
There is a line,
there's a line in the script,

360
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:08,763
and I think that was--

361
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:12,934
(laughs)
That was just an actor's reflex.

362
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:15,603
- Oh! (laughs)
- I'm sorry, I-- Can we do that again?

363
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,313
- Would you mind? Are you still rolling?
- Yes, please!

364
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,232
Keep rolling, guys. Keep rolling. OK.

365
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:23,945
Um... Let's just cut to the chase.

366
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,989
You've been involved
in some of the steamiest scenes

367
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,033
we've ever seen on television.

368
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:34,663
What is the secret to be a great lover?

369
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,166
I've never thought about it.

370
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,961
But, I guess...

371
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,679
First, you have to be selfless.

372
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,769
The pleasure of your lover
must become your own.

373
00:30:57,937 --> 00:31:03,275
But at the same time,
you must also remain... selfish,

374
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:08,530
because wanting someone so much
that it feels the same as the need...

375
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,700
to eat...

376
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:14,578
or to breathe...

377
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:20,542
this is where desire
becomes love, I guess.

378
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:22,586
(exhales)

379
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:29,051
Did you get that? OK. Yeah, yeah.

380
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:44,984
- 'Morning, Van Damme.
- 'Morning, Amondi.

381
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,902
You can call me Diana Prince.

382
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,988
Ah! Wonder Woman.

383
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:52,366
Shh! They call it a secret identity
for a reason.

384
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:54,451
OK, OK, got it.

385
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:57,538
(clears throat)

386
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:08,841
(Neets moans)

387
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:14,722
- 'Morning.
- Good morning.

388
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,686
(Neets) Mm...

389
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,439
My baby's back to feeling herself again.

390
00:32:24,523 --> 00:32:30,071
Mm... I don't know if it's the fact
that I still have my brain,

391
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:34,491
- or that you saved my life...
- Mm...

392
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,495
(♪ Fatboy Slim Featuring Macy Gray:
"Demons")

393
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,081
...or...

394
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:48,213
the fact that...
I'm laying here in your bedroom,

395
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:51,258
thinking about you sneaking out
as a teenager.

396
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:55,262
Mm-mm. Out of that very window.

397
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,722
(laughing)

398
00:32:56,805 --> 00:33:00,642
To go make out with--
What was her name?

399
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:02,310
- Zuzu.
- Zuzu.

400
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,812
(laughing)

401
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:08,901
- Zuzu. Mm.
- Mm.

402
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,362
(Diego) That's what I'm talking about.

403
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:14,197
You get into your own head too much,
Gorski.

404
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:15,741
(grunts)

405
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,911
That's what happened at Slugger's.

406
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:23,999
Hello, ladies. Lookin' good! Strong.

407
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,585
Come on, push it.
Five more, five more.

408
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:29,463
- (grunts)
- Seven.

409
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:32,507
Look at that.
You feel how it burns? Yeah?

410
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:37,138
(groans)

411
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,307
It's mind and body, yo.

412
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:45,020
Gotta tend to the temple.
Keep it flowing.

413
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:49,733
(grunts)

414
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:52,153
Push it out. Push that out!

415
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:53,988
(exhales)

416
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,451
- (laughs)
- Aah!

417
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:03,246
I gotta be honest with you, Will.

418
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,752
When I first got assigned to you...
that fucking name, "Gorski"...

419
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:14,675
I was picturing
some typical Chicago boover,

420
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:21,140
with a big-ass mustache
and gut dripping over his Bat belt.

421
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:25,144
But I gotta say,
you keep that shit looking tight, man.

422
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:29,148
- Ooh!
- Tango and Cash, baby.

423
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,526
(song continues)

424
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:38,991
(inaudible chatter)

425
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:18,423
I am gonna make love to you.

426
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:21,009
Like the first time we kissed.

427
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:23,887
(song continues)

428
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,428
(moans)

429
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,763
(gasps)

430
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,682
(groaning)

431
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:51,766
(gasps)

432
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,352
Aah!

433
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:12,454
I just had one of the best
orgasms of my life.

434
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,748
(laughs)

435
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:17,667
It's my turn.

436
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,669
(Jean-Claude grunting)

437
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:37,104
- (clears throat)
- (Nomi) <i>The question is,</i>

438
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:40,065
why these people, why these minds?

439
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:43,360
Why not a mind that feels, I don't know,
more in sync with my own?

440
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:46,654
- Maybe that's the point.
- How so?

441
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:49,783
I teach a class on evolution
every semester,

442
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:53,954
and we talk about the engine of evolution,
which is variation.

443
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:58,708
I imagine that to be something more than
what evolution would define as "yourself,"

444
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:01,544
you'd need something different
from yourself.

445
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:11,805
(creaking)

446
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:18,812
(guard) You'll sleep here tonight.

447
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:21,982
Tomorrow, you'll be transferred
to Cheongju Prison.

448
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:35,787
It's completely crazy-making
how all of these emotions,

449
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,998
they just come bubbling up out of nowhere.

450
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:40,167
Sounds like menopause.

451
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,170
Emotions are connected to the nervous
system, which would be affected by

452
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:47,799
- what is happening to your brain.
- Yeah. 'Cause what I want to know,

453
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:51,178
is there a way that I can stop it
from happening, or at least control it?

454
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:55,056
Like ADD, where I can take a drug
and limit the effect that it has on me?

455
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:58,143
Or is it like Alzheimer's,

456
00:39:58,226 --> 00:40:02,481
and that sense of me-ness will slowly,
inevitably disintegrate?

457
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,653
(crying)

458
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,868
(softly sobs)

459
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:34,346
Hello?

460
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:40,352
God, I'm sorry.

461
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,229
You don't have to apologize.

462
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:44,856
I thought I was alone.

463
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:48,151
Me, too.

464
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:51,946
I'm Riley.

465
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:55,409
Sun.

466
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:56,910
Sun?

467
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:00,038
Seriously?

468
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:05,419
- Yes.
- Wow, that is so weird.

469
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,295
Why?

470
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:09,797
Look.

471
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:19,015
(Sun) "I have conversed
with the spiritual sun."

472
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:35,198
I come here after working a long night,
to smoke, and... converse with the sun.

473
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:42,289
I would kill for a cigarette. (sighs)

474
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:47,502
- All I got is hash.
- What is hash?

475
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,381
It's like pot, but better.

476
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:00,014
Will this work?

477
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:01,516
Can't hurt to try.

478
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:13,403
I can taste it...

479
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:18,450
but it's more like a... memory.

480
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:23,163
It makes you feel good?

481
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:26,207
Sometimes.

482
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:31,254
In Iceland, we have a saying that

483
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:33,298
it's not the drugs
that make a drug addict,

484
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,925
it's the need to escape reality.

485
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:38,970
I understand.

486
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,058
Why are you here?

487
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:47,312
If you don't mind me asking.

488
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:51,149
(sighs)

489
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,196
I'm afraid I've just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

490
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:02,536
(man on screen) <i>Ah!</i>

491
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:06,456
- (man yells on screen)
- Time to go?

492
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,916
Good, let's go.

493
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:12,086
Watching Van Damme again?

494
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,672
Ah, yes.

495
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:16,216
Jean-Claude is a source of inspiration.

496
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:18,009
Inspiration to do what?

497
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,933
To believe you can make a difference,
that if you are brave,

498
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:29,521
you can fight to make the world
a more equal and just place.

499
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:32,524
Hm. I like Jean-Claude.

500
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:35,026
He wants to do the same thing
my dad wants to do.

501
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:37,779
- Really?
- Yes.

502
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:42,283
My dad says there are a lot of bad people
trying to hurt us and take our home away.

503
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:46,037
So we have to be brave and fight,
just like Jean-Claude.

504
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:53,754
So we are both in trouble
because of someone else's crime.

505
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:57,758
I knew Jacks was no good.

506
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,301
I knew what Joong-Ki was doing.

507
00:44:01,094 --> 00:44:02,679
Why are we here?

508
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,645
Have you heard of the Hidden People?

509
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:24,158
In Iceland, there are small people,

510
00:44:24,242 --> 00:44:26,911
like elves, who live in the land.

511
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,333
When I was young, I went into a cave
and I heard one singing.

512
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:38,840
She was singing a song my mother
used to sing to me when I was young.

513
00:44:41,342 --> 00:44:45,972
It's quite a terrible song
about a mother having to kill her baby,

514
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:48,600
but I always found it so comforting.

515
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:53,563
I heard her voice
several times over the years.

516
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:03,239
She told me I was born with a hex,
and that if I stayed in Iceland,

517
00:45:03,323 --> 00:45:08,620
bad things would happen to me,
and to the people that I loved.

518
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:20,006
And then my mother died, and...

519
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,093
And I believed it was my fault.

520
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,352
My mother died when I was young, too.

521
00:45:34,312 --> 00:45:38,525
I had no voice telling me
that I was hexed,

522
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:44,280
but I still believed
somehow it was my fault.

523
00:45:52,038 --> 00:45:56,042
Oh, I want to go home. (sighs)

524
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,795
I want to see my father.

525
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,381
You should go.

526
00:46:01,464 --> 00:46:03,299
I'm afraid.

527
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:07,303
Don't be.

528
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:11,265
Right now, you're safer there
than where you are.

529
00:46:16,437 --> 00:46:19,524
Tomorrow, I go to prison.

530
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:22,569
Are you afraid?

531
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:31,369
Don't be.

532
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:33,955
Why?

533
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:39,210
Because you're safer there
than where you were.

534
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:17,665
Mm... Mm!

535
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:19,417
What was that for?

536
00:47:20,418 --> 00:47:22,253
I don't know.

537
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:25,089
Just felt like something
I needed to do.

538
00:47:29,176 --> 00:47:30,553
I like that.

539
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,709
My child.

540
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:05,755
So beautiful and strong.

541
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,009
I'll always love you.

542
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:13,721
Remember to be careful, child.

543
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:21,562
They are afraid of you,
and they will hurt you if they find out.

544
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,315
Find out?

545
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,778
What you are.

546
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:31,781
What am I?

547
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:37,495
(whispers) The future.
