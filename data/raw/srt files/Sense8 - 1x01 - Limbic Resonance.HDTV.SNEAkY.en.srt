1
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,666
- I'm here.
- Jonas.

2
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,504
- Yes, my love.
- It hurts.

3
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:07,341
I know.

4
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,927
I need medicine.

5
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:12,404
I'm sorry, my love,
there's no more time.

6
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:14,057
It has to be now.

7
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,560
Not ready. I'm too weak.

8
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,438
None of us were ever as strong as you.

9
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:25,776
I don't want anyone else to die
because of me.

10
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:31,699
They'll be hunted... born or unborn.

11
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:35,619
You can give them a fighting chance.

12
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,093
I see them.

13
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:25,771
You did it.

14
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:31,110
Protect them.

15
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,324
They're here.

16
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,327
So is he.

17
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,291
- Fight him.
- I can't.

18
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,632
So this is how you've been hiding from me?

19
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:55,384
Does he know?

20
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,345
You're giving birth.

21
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,186
Oh...

22
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:08,438
It's painful. I can feel it.

23
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:11,358
Whatever he's saying,
remember what he has done.

24
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,485
- Go.
- Is that Jonas?

25
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,362
Please.

26
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:19,867
Tell him I'm looking forward
to meeting him.

27
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,493
I love you.

28
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:26,582
- I love you.
- Aw, does he know you're lying?

29
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,292
Stop.

30
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,669
Or is that still our little secret?

31
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:32,255
Angelica.

32
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,760
I... I can't do it... not if you're here.

33
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,722
I will always be here...

34
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:46,393
just as you will always be here.

35
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:59,323
Oh, come now, my dear,

36
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:03,202
how many times have you made that threat?

37
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,247
And we both know you won't do it.

38
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,332
You can't.

39
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:12,419
You are one of us, and there's still
so much work to be done.

40
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:20,552
You're coming home, with me.

41
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:21,720
No.

42
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:28,685
- Give me the gun.
- Put the gun down.

43
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,980
No.

44
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:32,481
Stop her!

Help me.

00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:01,023
OK.

52
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,988
Hello?

53
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,243
Hello? It's your neighbor.

54
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,129
Hey, open up!
This is the police!

55
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:22,812
She can spin for a girl, can't she?

56
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,856
She can spin.

57
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,150
Period.

58
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:32,322
Sure.

59
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:37,536
I don't care. I didn't dress for you.
I dressed for what is actually cool...

60
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,998
Oh, hey, baby.
Oh, hey... that set was on fire, man.

61
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,126
Yeah, the vibe was crackin', Riles.

62
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,878
It was like a...
like a tight leash around me goolies.

63
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:50,340
Seen a lot of people play here.
It doesn't feel like that.

64
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:54,470
- Thank you.
- This is the guy I was telling you about.

65
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,179
Everybody calls me Nyx.

66
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,683
Gotta come with us, man.
The shit that he has got

67
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:03,812
has got the power to blow
our fuckin' brains out.

68
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:13,405
- Sorry, really bad migraine.
- I get it. All that energy and emotion.

69
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,033
Tell him about your freak out
in the park.

70
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:21,371
- Jacks, you fuckin' dick.
- No, it's cool, man. Nyx, he gets it.

71
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:23,290
He said you had a vision.

72
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,460
No, it was too many drugs.

73
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,041
My son?

74
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,963
Tino! Don't do this.
Don't do this, I beg of you!

75
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,633
I love you! I love you!

76
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,719
- It's too late.
- Tino.

77
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,429
Have you come to confess your sins,
my son?

78
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,057
No, Padre.

79
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,977
I've come to blow
your fucking brains out.

80
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,773
What?

81
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,442
I'm sorry,
are we going off script?

82
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:36,446
Cut! Cut!

83
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,947
Padre, take five.

84
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,825
Lito, what is going on with you?

85
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,494
Yesterday, you were having visions

86
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:44,162
- of suicidal angels...
- I'm sorry.

87
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,289
and today you can't
remember your lines.

88
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,584
Are you OK, baby?

89
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,754
I don't know.
I'm not feeling myself today.

90
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,631
I don't need you to be yourself.

91
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:58,552
I need you to be this guy,
Tino El Caído.

92
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,053
- Right.
- El Caído.

93
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:02,431
- Right, right. OK.
- El Caído,<i> cabrón!</i>

94
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,391
- Let's do it.
- OK, people!

95
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:06,602
Let's set up for the close-up right here!

96
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,608
<i>Ms. Bak, your brother's assistant called.</i>

97
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:16,945
<i>She said he still wasn't here,</i>
<i>and Mr. Yuen has just arrived.</i>

98
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:23,702
I'll meet Mr. Yuen
in the conference room.

99
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,580
<i>Ni hao,</i> Mr. Yuen.

100
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,666
You do us a great service
with your presence this morning.

101
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,335
- Who are you?
- I'm Sun Bak,

102
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:35,714
Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer.

103
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:38,467
Ahh. The sister.

104
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,928
Where is your brother?

105
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,181
He was... unavoidably detained.

106
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,892
But I will be happy to walk you
through our proposal.

107
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,395
Look, I'm here to close.

108
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,481
Women don't close things.

109
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:57,277
They open them.

110
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,572
Excuse me?

111
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:05,118
If Joong-Ki is not here,
that means Bak is not ready to...

112
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:08,789
Tan-Wu!
You sly old fox.

113
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:12,584
Did I see you at Min-Ji's?

114
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:44,407
Hey, sis, go get us a couple coffees.

115
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:45,992
Come this way.

116
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:01,174
My nieces come downstairs,
two little birds,

117
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,677
they climb onto the couch,
and cuddle up in my arms.

118
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,597
Now we're close and all, but we've never
done nothing like this in their lives.

119
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,683
We didn't know it yet,
but that exact moment,

120
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:13,311
my sister was at the supermarket,
and she started bleeding bad.

121
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,689
Something internal.
There was blood everywhere,

122
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:19,275
and they had to call an ambulance,
but my nieces knew.

123
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,153
- They knew about my sister.
- Knew.

124
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:25,574
Somehow they just knew she was in trouble.

125
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,951
Limbic resonance.

126
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,994
It's a language older than our species.

127
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,080
He thinks that's what
happened to you in the park,

128
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:35,792
and it's all got to do
with this chemical, DMT.

129
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:39,170
It's a simple molecule
present in all living things.

130
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:43,884
Scientists talk about it being part
of an eco-biological synaptic network.

131
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:49,389
When people take it, they see their birth,
their death, worlds beyond this one.

132
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,641
They talk of truth...

133
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,687
connection... transcendence.

134
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:05,029
Dad? Dad, where are the umbrellas?
I can't find the umbrellas.

135
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:07,198
What do you need an umbrella for?

136
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,200
Please, no jokes. I'm late already.

137
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:11,995
I have a big meeting,
and I can't show up dripping wet.

138
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,206
Umbrellas are upstairs,
but you don't need one.

139
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,629
Look, the sun is shining.
It's going to be a beautiful day.

140
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,590
But, I heard it.

141
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:27,469
Maybe you shouldn't be going to work.
It's so close to the wedding.

142
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:30,931
- Dad, you know work is important to me.
- I know.

143
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:34,225
You sent me to university to get a degree,
not to find a husband.

144
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,813
- I know.
- I heard thunder, and rain.

145
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:40,649
Maybe what you heard
was the sound of your father's tears,

146
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:44,653
thinking how soon he is going to have
to give his daughter away.

147
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:48,364
I thought you were happy
I was getting married.

148
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:54,913
Tears can be happy... and sad.

149
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:05,548
We are born into this world
the same way we shall leave it:

150
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,759
alone.

151
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:13,097
Our only comfort,
the only presence that remains constant,

152
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:16,100
is the love of our Father in heaven.

153
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:28,571
You all right?

154
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,907
Migraine.

155
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,170
I'm like Grandpa Hassan up there.

156
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,797
Cold and pickled?

157
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,384
I dream big, like he did.

158
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:52,595
Nothing petty, like you two.

159
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,141
That's all you'll ever be, petty thieves.
Not me.

160
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:01,479
My next score is gonna be huge.
Legendary.

161
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:05,775
When you hear about it,
your dicks are gonna shrivel.

162
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:17,286
I'm not sure what'll give me more
pleasure... the money, or seeing his face.

163
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,008
My son.

164
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,845
Why are you so good to me?

165
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,807
You are my one and only mother.

166
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:42,228
You gave me the light
and love in my heart.

167
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:00,496
I have to go.

168
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,877
Goodbye, my zebra.

169
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,756
I have this feeling.

170
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,092
I'm going to have a really good day today.

171
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:39,368
"When the streets are a jungle,
there can only be one king."

172
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:10,733
Oh, God.

173
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:16,906
Yeah. Oh, God.

174
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:31,295
Oh, God.

175
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,303
Oh...

176
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:52,150
Good?

177
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,611
Did that help honey's headache?

178
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,407
I can't answer that,

179
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,326
because you literally
just fucked my brains out.

180
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:07,082
And here I always thought
that was a figurative expression.

181
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,921
- Happy Pride.
- Happy Pride.

182
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,136
Oh... come on.

183
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:30,563
It's Shawn. He's asking if I can work
the charity box at the show tonight!

184
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:35,193
- I sense a costume opportunity.
- Ah... It's for a good cause.

185
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:42,533
Who are you?

186
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,702
Who am I?

187
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,372
Blow your fucking brains out.

188
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:49,916
Where's that coming from?

189
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:56,256
Tino El Caído. I'm the fallen one.

190
00:23:05,223 --> 00:23:06,641
Pah-pah-pah-pah!

191
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,977
Who am I? I'm Tino El Caído.

192
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:10,645
I'm the fallen one.

193
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,939
And you're a liar. You're a liar.

194
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,734
I'm Tino El Caído.

195
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:23,116
I'm Tino El Caído. I'm the fallen one.

196
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,076
Diet Coke, please!

197
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,289
What happened in my past nobody knows,
not the writers, not the directors.

198
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm a man... Bah! Bah-pah!

199
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:37,839
A man with a haunted past,
that's what the script says.

200
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,593
Bah-bah!

201
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:48,641
What are you doing to me?

202
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:57,608
Yeah?

203
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,403
Hey.

204
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,988
Hey.

205
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,325
Just checking everything is OK.

206
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:07,035
Yeah.

207
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:08,494
- Yeah?
- Everything's OK.

208
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:11,122
I just thought maybe
I did something wrong.

209
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:14,750
No, no. Please, no.
You were great. You were fantastic.

210
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,920
It was me that, you know, I...

211
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,591
You're just always so perfect.

212
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:26,095
I don't know what is going on with me.

213
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:41,236
Maybe there's something
that I can help you with?

214
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,953
Wait, wait.

215
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:52,455
Wait, Cassandra.

216
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,499
There is nothing I'd like more.

217
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:00,796
If only my heart
did not belong to another.

218
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,012
I'm sorry.

219
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:13,601
She's a very lucky woman.

220
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:16,938
I'm sorry. I...

221
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:19,982
I'm sorry.

222
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,425
Thank you for coming.
It means a lot to us.

223
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:47,885
Sorry, Auntie.

224
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,230
Last few days,
all he talked about was your father.

225
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:03,359
Saddest day in his life,
the day your father died.

226
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:06,988
You should go say hello.
We'll wait for you.

227
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:11,742
Pay your respects. He was your father.

228
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,815
- Yes?
- When are we leaving?

229
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,734
- Right now.
- I have to be downtown by nine.

230
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:28,444
You'll be there long before nine, Ma'am.

231
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:31,155
Come rain or shine,
Van Damn is always on time.

232
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,366
- We need to go.
- We need more customers.

233
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:34,969
We're barely covering the cost of gas.

234
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,161
We don't need customers,
we need a Facebook page.

235
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:38,621
- Look at this.
- Jela.

236
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:48,339
Every day is the same.
Everybody loves Bat Van.

237
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:52,301
You dumb fucks!
No one gives a shit about Van Damn!

238
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,604
- Maybe he's right.
- No.

239
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:05,147
- Maybe Jean-Claude's time is over.
- No! Never!

240
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:07,775
Come on, Capheus,
Van Damme is a man.

241
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:10,236
He doesn't need costumes
and gadgets to fight.

242
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,447
He fights with the fist
and with his heart.

243
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,699
Come on!
The Muscles from Brussels never die.

244
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:16,992
Don't forget that.

245
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:20,622
Come on.

246
00:28:20,704 --> 00:28:22,582
- And get us more customers.
- I will.

247
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:24,792
- Excuse me.
- Whoo!

248
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,753
Jean Claude is watching over us.
Yes, sir, are you going to the city?

249
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,297
- Yes, please.
- Then take a seat.

250
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,050
- No, but I've got no money.
- Um... Everyone must pay.

251
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,971
- Here.
- What am I supposed to do with this?

252
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,514
This is worth more than the fare.

253
00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:43,978
Look, I believe you, but how
do I return change out of a chicken?

254
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:45,938
Save me an egg.

255
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:08,461
<i>Ms. Bak, I have Mr. Jong</i>
<i>from Seoul Citibank on the line again.</i>

256
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:14,634
Tell Mr. Jong that I'm in a meeting.

257
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:41,536
Hang on. Riley! Hey!

258
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:44,079
Me and Nocker have been waitin' for you.

259
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,124
Sorry. I thought you'd gone already.

260
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:51,295
Nyx has invited us up to his place.

261
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,549
Oh, look, maybe tomorrow, OK?

262
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,385
Riles, this is important.

263
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:00,638
Look, this headache is killing me.

264
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:02,390
Tomorrow, OK?

265
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,850
OK...

266
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:09,063
The stuff that he's talking about,
that is exactly what you need.

267
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,231
Oh!

268
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:53,775
Whoo!

269
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:56,318
- Hi!
- Remember your first brownie?

270
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,903
Our first Pride.

271
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:07,037
Your lips... are so... amazing.

272
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:09,915
My God, we were so high.

273
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:12,794
Oh, my God, we were.

274
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:14,462
Are you following me?

275
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:17,799
- Need some delicious, nutritious stuff?
- Um...

276
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,383
Maybe this is what you need.

277
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,302
- Yeah.
- OK, OK, we'll take one.

278
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:22,470
Yeah. All right.

279
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:23,763
- Go for it.
- How much?

280
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,097
You'll never be the same again.

281
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,933
- OK, OK. OK, OK.
- Thank you very much.

282
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,059
Happy journey.

283
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:30,561
- Happy Pride!
- Happy Pride!

284
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:32,062
Bye!

285
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,820
Mm...

286
00:31:43,658 --> 00:31:46,285
But you know what I remember best
about that day?

287
00:31:56,754 --> 00:31:59,173
Hey, y'all, this is the one
I've been talking about.

288
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:03,135
Wait, I know you. You're the tranny
that blogs about politics.

289
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:06,597
I totally disagree with what you said
about dropping LGBT.

290
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:10,351
- Hey, come on, relax. It's a party.
- We fought hard for that recognition.

291
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,728
I just thought that the distinctions
were separating us.

292
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:16,691
Bullshit. Just another colonizing male
trying to take up any space left to women.

293
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,567
Sam, say one more thing
about my girlfriend

294
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:20,331
and I will colonize your face
with my fist.

295
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:21,570
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm gonna go.

296
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:23,614
Oh, please.
She's a loud-mouth Berkeley bitch.

297
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,199
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

298
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,909
Hey, No... Nomi!

299
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:32,456
Wait! Honey, what is it?
You never cry at stuff like that.

300
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:37,503
I'm not crying because of her.

301
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,130
Then what?

302
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:44,051
I'm crying because
no one's ever defended me before.

303
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:53,268
Mwah!

304
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:56,814
That's the day I knew
I'd always love you.

305
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,215
My Lord Ganesha.

306
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,888
I hope you like this modak.

307
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:31,014
I made it especially for you.

308
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,852
I put peanuts on top.

309
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:40,942
I mean, of course, these gifts come
without any attachments or obligations.

310
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:43,569
I am trying to become a better person.

311
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:47,949
I know I am not important enough
to deserve your attention

312
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:52,035
when there are so many terrible things
wrong in this world.

313
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:57,165
I can't tell you how bad I feel
even being here,

314
00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:00,920
because I know I shouldn't be
asking you this.

315
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,050
But I have no one else to turn to.

316
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:13,265
OK, um... this weekend,

317
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:18,813
I am to marry a very important man,
who you probably know, Rajan Rasal.

318
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:23,651
Um, he is the son of the owner of
the pharmaceutical company where I work.

319
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:26,069
He's very smart and very handsome,

320
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:30,449
and all the women at the company
want desperately to marry him,

321
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:33,035
but he never took an interest in anyone...

322
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,704
except me.

323
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:41,043
I should tell you, I have never
seen my parents so full of joy

324
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:44,129
as when they received his proposal.

325
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:49,384
I mean, I thought they were excited
when I received my degree from university.

326
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:53,388
Maybe you saw my dad, like,
dancing around the house.

327
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,895
How could I say no?

328
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:06,986
I mean, Rajan is, according to everyone,
including my mom's astrologer,

329
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:09,363
the perfect husband for me.

330
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,536
Except for one little fact.

331
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:25,629
I do not love him.

332
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:35,556
After you left the funeral...
Sergei started blowing on about your dad.

333
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:42,897
Said there wasn't a better box man
in the world than your dad, now or ever.

334
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:46,525
Said the only reason your dad got caught

335
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:51,530
was because he was obsessed
with trying to crack an S&D safe.

336
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,908
Said they're uncrackable.

337
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:58,203
Said your father was an idiot for trying.

338
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,877
You sure that gets us in?

339
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,421
Am I sure?
You notice the sign outside?

340
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:11,216
See you tomorrow.

341
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:14,553
Wolfgang?

342
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:18,057
The safe in the house,
it's one of them S&D's, isn't it?

343
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,146
Give 'til it hearts, baby.

344
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,647
My box needs filling!

345
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:28,025
Mm, thank you, baby.

346
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:30,027
Hi!

347
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:32,821
- Oh!
- Wow, she is amazing.

348
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:35,074
Neets loves her charity work.

349
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:40,328
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, my God, of course.

350
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:44,875
- We're so excited to see your new piece.
- A bit nervous about it, actually.

351
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:49,337
- Why?
- Well, it's kind of a downer.

352
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:52,800
- So?
- This is Pride. People want to feel good.

353
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,136
I don't.

354
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:58,639
During the '80s,
Pride was a funeral march.

355
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:01,976
I know. I want to remember that.
I want to connect to that.

356
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,146
I want to show people
how my life and all of this

357
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,273
is made possible
by those lives and those deaths.

358
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:19,367
I walked in the room
and saw a man in his early 30s

359
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:21,954
who looked like he was 92,

360
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:26,291
who was skin and bones,
who weighed maybe 80 pounds,

361
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,251
who was on a respirator.

362
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:33,423
And, uh...
and he said, he said to me...

363
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,719
"Do me this...
You've gotta do me a favor."

364
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:40,347
And I said, "Whatever it is, just ask."

365
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:44,185
And he said, "I can't go on like this."

366
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:50,107
He said, "You know, I just...
If you could, just carry me up to the roof

367
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:53,068
and throw me over the... roof."

368
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:59,658
He goes, "I only weigh about 80 pounds,
and you're strong, you could do it."

369
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:03,996
And then I said, "Jay, I can't do that.
You can't ask that of me."

370
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:11,879
- And when he died, they came in...
- in hazmat... suits,

371
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,631
and they put him in a body bag.

372
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,635
It's like I was there.

373
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,346
I could feel the wind coming in
through the broken windows.

374
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:09,311
The smell of burnt mattress.
It didn't seem like a dream.

375
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:12,189
Maybe you were astro-projecting,
like Dr. Strange.

376
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:14,608
Why would I expect anything
different from you?

377
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:17,402
- Officer Strange.
- Fuck off.

378
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:20,739
Officer Strange. Whoo!
That's your name.

379
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,294
Every time I come down here,

380
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,338
I remember how much you can
actually feel how much they hate us.

381
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:41,051
Gangbangers hate cops,
cops hate gangbangers. It's natural.

382
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:42,636
How's that natural?

383
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:53,897
Like dogs hate cats.
They're the enemy.

384
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:57,818
You certainly got
plenty of reason to hate them.

385
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,653
After what they did to your old man?

386
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,948
Shit, I'd never forgive
something like that.

387
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,202
<i>One-Adam-12,</i>
<i>we have a report of gunfire.</i>

388
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:08,954
Eleven-12, 10-4.

389
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:13,125
With any luck,
there'll be a few less cats in the world.

390
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,002
Let's get 'em, cowboy.

391
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,260
Open sesame.

392
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,269
Was that a siren?

393
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:17,856
Huh? Didn't hear anything.

394
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,029
You know I brought a drill.

395
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,910
There's no shame in drilling.

396
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,499
Shots fired. Requesting backup.

397
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:00,250
Help me.

398
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:09,343
What happened?

399
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:12,429
Gunshot wound. Looks like a hollow point.

400
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:17,351
- Get an ambulance.
- What?

401
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:20,521
- You heard me.
- What do you think this is, TV?

402
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:23,440
Ain't no ambulance coming to Chi-raq
for a gunshot.

403
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:26,067
Not fast enough
to make a difference anyway.

404
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:31,114
The fuck you doing, Gorski?

405
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:33,575
Hey. What's your name, kid?

406
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:36,537
- Deshawn.
- Deshawn, I'm Will.

407
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:40,499
I need you to press this
as hard as you can.

408
00:43:40,582 --> 00:43:42,709
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Press as hard as you can.

409
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:47,589
Are you kidding me?

410
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:50,758
I know you, Diego. You do not want to
stand there and let this kid die either.

411
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:52,594
That's what he'd do if it was you or me.

412
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:59,351
Goddamnit.

413
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,447
Fifty-eight minutes.

414
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:23,917
Fuck.

415
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:30,632
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

416
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:36,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

417
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:37,514
What's this?

418
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:39,057
We're throwing in the towel?

419
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,226
I need a break.

420
00:44:42,185 --> 00:44:44,145
Hey, you understand
we got less than an hour,

421
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:47,315
unless I'm wrong and Steiner's early,
then we got less than that.

422
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:49,776
You're never wrong about shit like that.

423
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:56,074
Really?

424
00:44:58,619 --> 00:44:59,869
Really?

425
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:03,039
It relaxes me.

426
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:06,751
This shit relaxes you?

427
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:17,471
Hang on.

428
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:22,392
- You OK?
- Just a little cold.

429
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:29,608
This your first time
in the back seat, Will?

430
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:31,731
I've been back here more times
than I care to admit.

431
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:35,071
Are you some sort of
gangsta cop or somethin'?

432
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:38,908
Old man's police. Had my fair share
of teenage rebellion, I guess.

433
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:43,455
Never met my dad.
He was shot before I was born.

434
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,800
This girl, she's really good.

435
00:45:57,135 --> 00:46:00,138
Her name's Natalie.
I watched her last week.

436
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:02,890
She sings like a musical instrument.

437
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:06,687
She uses a language of pure emotion.

438
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,855
Yeah, yeah, she's good.

439
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:16,446
- She's never gonna win.
- Why?

440
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,451
Her eyes are too close together.
She looks like a camel.

441
00:46:24,454 --> 00:46:25,830
Shut up.

442
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:28,791
Camel's never gonna win.

443
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,128
Never.

444
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:38,343
Wolfgang.

445
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:48,353
Wolfgang.

446
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:26,767
Told you.

447
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:20,320
Emergency! Kid's bleeding bad here.

448
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,280
- That's a gunshot.
- Yeah, I know.

449
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,574
- I'm sorry, we can't treat that here.
- What?

450
00:48:24,658 --> 00:48:28,328
Are you new? You need to go and get
an ambulance and take him to Mt. Sinai.

451
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,455
The kid's gonna be dead
before we get there.

452
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:34,501
- I'm sorry. It's policy.
- What kind of policy lets a kid die?

453
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:36,919
We were losing so many
resources to gunshots,

454
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:40,043
we couldn't take care of all the other
patients that needed help around here.

455
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:43,760
We've been a better hospital
since we stopped taking kids like him.

456
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:46,888
Please.

457
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:50,056
Please.

458
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:09,661
That's it.

459
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:13,122
Fuck. It's over. Hey.

460
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:37,939
Shit.

461
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:39,982
It's Steiner! We gotta go.

462
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:42,068
Hey, Wolfgang.

463
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,319
Please.

464
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:44,987
He's going to fucking kill us.

465
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:46,656
I don't want to die!

466
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:36,080
You cracked the uncrackable.

467
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:38,750
You did it.

468
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:41,836
Yeah.

469
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:43,922
OK.

470
00:51:24,378 --> 00:51:29,050
Dr. Manno just came out of surgery.
Life signs are stable.

471
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,760
He'll probably make it.

472
00:51:30,844 --> 00:51:31,970
OK.

473
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:34,472
Thanks.

474
00:51:34,555 --> 00:51:36,599
Can I ask you a personal question?

475
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,438
If he lives and he kills someone,
let's say a cop,

476
00:51:42,522 --> 00:51:44,315
how you gonna feel about that?

477
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:35,760
You all right?

478
00:53:38,304 --> 00:53:39,680
You're sweating.

479
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:49,857
- Your pulse is racing.
- I'm fine.

480
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:51,358
You're scared.

481
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:54,361
You needn't be.

482
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:58,658
You're so beautiful.

483
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:01,744
I don't just mean in a physical way.

484
00:54:02,954 --> 00:54:06,916
The warmth... pouring out of your heart.

485
00:54:09,794 --> 00:54:12,005
Even though you work hard to hide it.

486
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:20,638
You don't belong with these men.

487
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:24,391
You know it's true.

488
00:54:26,227 --> 00:54:27,353
Don't you?

489
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:33,901
I used to be like you.

490
00:54:36,237 --> 00:54:40,366
Like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth.

491
00:54:42,952 --> 00:54:45,746
I used anything I could to insulate.

492
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:50,501
Music... books... booze.

493
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:56,174
Anything I could to keep myself
separate from the rest of the world.

494
00:54:58,676 --> 00:55:01,262
Eventually I felt protected,
you know, I...

495
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,224
I felt safe.

496
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:09,812
But also...

497
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:16,527
I never felt so... completely alone.

498
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:25,619
Then one day a friend, she gave me a gift.

499
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:27,997
She took away my armor.

500
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:30,291
She tore down my walls.

501
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:36,297
Her gift... it reminded me

502
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,467
what it felt like... to be alive.

503
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,225
What did she give you?

504
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,810
This.

505
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:48,781
- Stop the car.
- Hm?

506
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:51,492
- I said stop the car!
- What the fuck?

507
00:58:58,332 --> 00:59:00,167
This is where it happened.

508
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,961
What happened?

509
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:05,881
It's where she killed herself.

510
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:10,803
Shit.

511
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:37,037
This is it.

512
00:59:37,121 --> 00:59:39,039
Ah, hell no.

513
00:59:39,165 --> 00:59:40,958
This wasn't a dream.

514
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:44,003
Of all the partners,
I end up with a Mulder-wannabe.

515
00:59:45,546 --> 00:59:48,841
- D, a woman killed herself right here.
- Where's the blood, Will?

516
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:51,469
Maybe she only shot herself
in the fifth dimension,

517
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:52,719
so we can't see the blood.

518
00:59:52,803 --> 00:59:55,055
OK, I've never been here before.

519
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,228
I know about this.

520
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:02,980
Drugs.

521
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:06,692
There's a gun, too.

522
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:08,068
There's shit everywhere, man.

523
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:10,279
Look, you're freakin' me out.

524
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:15,159
Show me evidence of a crime,
and you got me.

525
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:21,748
So, until then, do your little séance,
and I'll be in the car. All right?

526
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:53,280
Uh... Hi.

527
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,660
This is where she died.

528
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,539
Did you know her?

529
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,126
How do you know she died here?

530
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,255
I saw her.

531
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:12,383
Do you live here?

532
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:17,513
Where do you live?

533
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:19,599
London.

534
01:01:22,142 --> 01:01:23,394
What are you doing here?

535
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:25,521
I don't know.

536
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:29,609
I don't know where I am.

537
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:33,237
Chicago, near South Side.

538
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,988
In America?

539
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:40,411
I've never been to America.

540
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:47,960
Oh, no! What are you doing?

541
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:51,004
Don't you fucking move!

542
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,553
- Stop.
- Open the fucking safe!

543
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:04,644
Why are you doing this?

544
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:09,106
He has just had a shipment come in,
and me and Nocker have been trackin' it.

545
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:12,067
We were gonna hit him yesterday,
but he wanted you here.

546
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,696
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.

547
01:02:16,822 --> 01:02:21,452
Now, a smart guy like you...
probably has a gun in there.

548
01:02:21,535 --> 01:02:25,080
- Don't hurt him.
- Oh, yeah.

549
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:29,585
Is that why you came? 'Cause you wanna...
Do you wanna fuck him?

550
01:02:31,962 --> 01:02:36,550
Riles, he will kill you without blinking
if I didn't have this.

551
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,514
- I fuckin' told you. Here.
- I have to go.

552
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:45,351
No, no, no, no, no. Riley. You're not...
You're not going anywhere.

553
01:02:45,434 --> 01:02:47,687
- You're part of this. No, no, no.
- Let me go.

554
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:52,899
Riles, Riles... this is the break
that we've been waiting for.

555
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:55,569
Fill it up.

556
01:02:59,072 --> 01:03:00,324
Fill it up!

557
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:07,122
Riles, this is our chance.

558
01:03:07,247 --> 01:03:12,211
You said that you wanted to go to America.
We wanted a different life.

559
01:03:12,294 --> 01:03:15,422
That's... That's what you said, right?
