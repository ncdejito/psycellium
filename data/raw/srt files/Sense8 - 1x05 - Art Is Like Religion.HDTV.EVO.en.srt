00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,252
I don't get it.

3
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,307
Why do we have to shoot
the end of the film first?

4
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,897
It's ridiculous.

5
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,617
Some things never change.

6
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,604
I feel a little bit bloated today.

7
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,529
You look fantastic, Lito. Come on.

8
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,923
I... I feel like shit today. Please.

9
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,065
- Can I get some Advil, please?
- Sure.

10
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,278
Are you for real?

11
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,203
Are you for real?

12
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,675
- Here it is.
- Did you see?

13
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,308
See what?

14
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:29,014
- The fuck were you thinkin'?
- Sir?

15
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,905
I just spent the last hour on the phone
getting my ass reamed by the Feds.

16
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,169
- OK, sir, I can...
- You can shut the fuck up.

17
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:40,227
You will know when I'm done speaking
because there will be a pause,

18
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:45,206
followed by the words "I'm sorry, Captain,
this will never happen again."

19
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,880
Pullin' in favors?

20
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:51,358
Tryin' to use your old man's rep
to get around direct orders? For what?

21
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:58,093
- Was that a pause?
- Jesus flying fuckballs.

22
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:01,901
Sorry, listen, when I saw Jonas at that
store, I felt like there was a connection.

23
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,160
I thought maybe I could use that
to get some intelligence.

24
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,708
No luck there.

25
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,596
Intelligence would have meant
doing what you were told.

26
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,031
None of us have time
for any more of your fuckin' around.

27
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,633
That was the pause.

28
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,432
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

29
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,771
Never happen again.

30
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:22,362
Now get the fuck outta here.

31
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:38,637
Ah!

32
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,445
- Wolfgang.
- Uncle.

33
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,077
I have a problem.

34
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,843
But the thing about my problems is...

35
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,320
that they tend to become
other people's problems.

36
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:55,918
Sit down, please.

37
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:12,445
There was a robbery a few days ago.

38
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,662
Black market diamonds from Mumbai.

39
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:19,600
Stolen from a safe the day before
they were to be picked up by the buyer.

40
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:27,005
I know this because my son
had been casing this place for months.

41
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:30,897
Pickups, deliveries,
when the place was empty.

42
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:36,671
Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:39,558
And there are few things
as unpleasant for me

44
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,069
as listening to my own son whine.

45
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:51,733
The interesting part is...
the safe was not drilled.

46
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:55,122
No one bored through
to look at the tumblers,

47
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,926
poured liquid nitrogen
or acid inside.

48
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:00,061
No, no, no, no.

49
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,789
The safe was cracked.

50
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,055
Yeah.

51
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:15,374
More interesting still is...
that the safe was an S&D.

52
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,269
The same kind of safe
that fucked your father.

53
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,195
Mm.

54
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:31,733
It would be an irony
of Shakespearean proportions

55
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:35,290
if his son fucked his own life

56
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,726
cracking the safe his father
failed to crack, wouldn't it?

57
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm not as stupid as my father.

58
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:58,302
Wolfgang? Your father made mistakes.

59
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,019
Every man does.

60
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,580
You should always remember who you are.

61
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:15,333
I think about that every day.

62
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,944
I don't understand.

63
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:54,956
You speak English?

64
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:01,148
- Uh... You speak English?
- Oh, yes.

65
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,115
I speak very good English.

66
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,337
Where am I?

67
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:11,482
It's so warm, I can feel the heat.

68
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,370
Kibera, Nairobi.

69
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,963
In Africa?

70
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:21,274
Africa... Kenya.

71
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:26,294
Where is this? This is freezing.

72
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,926
London.

73
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,562
London. Ah...

74
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,785
<i>Harry Potter.</i> The Queen. Eh?

75
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,972
English tea.

76
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,031
Can I?

77
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,789
I like it.

78
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,052
Hey, Van Damme,
give me the fucking bag.

79
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,185
I can't do that.

80
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,990
Give it to me
or we beat the fuck out of you.

81
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,408
I don't want to hurt you.

82
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:46,671
If your enemy will not be humbled,
destroy him.

83
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:49,182
Give the bag, bitch!

84
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:09,976
Van Sham.

85
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:42,403
Spirit of Jean-Claude Korean lady,

86
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,043
I know you have
more important things to do,

87
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:48,680
but for me, nothing is more important.

88
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:11,733
OK, Lito.
So, big scene: boy meets girl.

89
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:15,415
You have started working for her father,
Don Carlos. Right?

90
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,930
Am I beginning to suspect that
he is behind the death squads?

91
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:22,905
No, definitely not.
You find him charming.

92
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,625
- But I think I sense he is evil, right?
- No, not at all. No.

93
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,345
- You are just hot for his daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey.

94
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,446
The script is full of so much pain.

95
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:34,831
I think I should feel it.

96
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,595
- No, not at all. Here.
- Hey...

97
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,817
You need fire, you need heat, OK?

98
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,491
- We're going to keep it sexy.
- OK, yeah.

99
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,122
- Can you keep it sexy for me?
- Yeah.

100
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,256
Yes? El Caído, remember.

101
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,311
OK, can we shoot today? Yes?

102
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,779
Are we ready? OK. Here we go.

103
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,917
<i>- </i>Nachito! Come on!
- Take position, everyone!

104
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:58,429
We're ready to shoot! Come on!

105
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,524
Boy!

106
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,909
Bah!

107
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,294
Bah-bah-bah! Bah!

108
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,312
And action!

109
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,064
Cut!

110
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:44,620
Lito, what are you doing?

111
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,796
Tears are not hot.

112
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:51,149
- Tears are not sexy.
- Sorry. My fault.

113
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:55,584
Um... I'm just feeling
a little emotional today.

114
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:00,018
I was suddenly struck by her beauty

115
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:05,583
and the knowledge that...
all beauty is temporary.

116
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:08,512
Decay and death
haunt every breath we take.

117
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:12,947
Lito, are you kidding me?
Lighten up.

118
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:17,005
"Decay and death"?
This is a movie, for fuck's sake.

119
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,348
OK, people. Come on. Nachito!

120
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,440
We don't have all day! Come on!

121
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,620
Take your positions, everyone!
We're going again! Come on!

122
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:27,256
OK, Lito,
take a breathe or something.

123
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,266
Wait, wait, wait!

124
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:33,533
- I need makeup, man. Bring me the makeup.
- Makeup!

125
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:39,599
Mehndi represents the outer
and the inner sun of your being.

126
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,195
It is the awakening of your inner light.

127
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,834
It strengthens and deepens the bond

128
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:49,977
between you and the man
who's to be your husband.

129
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,537
- Mom?
- Hm?

130
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:57,968
How did you feel about Dad at this point?

131
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:03,199
We had met only once
when we were very young...

132
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,797
when his family came to Punjab.

133
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:11,316
Were you nervous? Excited?

134
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,955
Did you think Dad
was gonna make you happy?

135
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,516
Things were much different then.

136
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,650
Love marriages were not very common.

137
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:26,755
I think, uh, you are the first
in the family, in fact, to marry for love.

138
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,437
But many things are the same.

139
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,043
My family wished the same thing for me
as we wish for you.

140
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,136
And he's a perfect match for you.

141
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,361
You know, my astrologer saw many children.

142
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:50,269
Everything is going to be all right,
my dear.

143
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,955
- Everything's going to be perfect.
- Yes.

144
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,969
Aah! Don't move!

145
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:09,057
Don't move.

146
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,358
What is wrong with you?

147
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:25,750
Never have I seen you
this unfocused before.

148
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,562
- You are of two minds.
- At least.

149
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,277
What?

150
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:34,119
Nothing, teacher.

151
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:38,973
There are better ways
that I could be spending my time.

152
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:48,637
Whatever is distracting you,
whatever it is you must decide or do,

153
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:54,956
decide it and do it,
and then come back to me.

154
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:10,269
I'm a fucking mess.
I'm a fucking mess, Hernando.

155
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,984
<i>The set doctor said you were fine.</i>

156
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:14,788
Fine? Fine?

157
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,884
No, no, Hernando, I'm not fine.
I have a horrible pain in my stomach.

158
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,856
It's... I'm paralyzed. I'm...

159
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,454
It feels like a tumor.

160
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:30,269
You know cancer runs in my family,
Hernando. What if it's cancer?

161
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,240
What is it? What is...

162
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,871
What is the point? What is the point?

163
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:38,302
My lane isn't going any faster,
you... fuck!

164
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,068
I see you, villain!

165
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:45,416
I see you with your
fucking villain mustache!

166
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,725
- Fuck!
- <i>Calm down, Lito.</i>

167
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:53,365
- I'm under attack, Hernando!
- <i> OK, take a deep breath, please.</i>

168
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,499
I can't.

169
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,637
I can't breathe! I can't think!

170
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,901
I... I can't remember anything!

171
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:05,792
- Hernando... Hernando? Are you there?
<i>- Yes, yes, yes, I am here.</i>

172
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:10,018
You know, before, I went to order <i>elotes</i>.
You know I love <i>elotes.</i>

173
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,524
<i>Yes, you love </i>elotes<i>, yes.</i>

174
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,457
But when I tried to order them, I couldn't
remember that <i>elotes</i> are called <i>elotes.</i>

175
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,298
<i>Lito, you're going to have an accident.</i>

176
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,817
Oh, you did not! Excuse me! I... You...

177
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:25,206
You tacky, cheap weave,
plastic-titted whore!

178
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:28,386
I see you! I see you!

179
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,102
Please stop screaming.

180
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:31,651
I'm not screaming!

181
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,605
Where am I?

182
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,867
<i>Lito, please, listen to me.</i>

183
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:46,796
I don't know where I am, Hernando.
Hernando?

184
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:48,721
<i>Are you hearing voices?</i>

185
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:52,152
No, I'm... I'm seeing things.

186
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,993
<i>Seeing things?</i>

187
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,922
There's... There's a crying Korean woman.

188
00:18:56,923 --> 00:19:01,106
I'm not... crying.

189
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,076
There's a Korean woman
standing next to me,

190
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,718
and she's not crying the same way
that I'm not screaming!

191
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,411
<i>Lito, what happened?</i>

192
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:17,047
What the fuck?!

193
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,228
- Hernando, please save me.
- Where you get your license, man?

194
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,831
Fuck! Hey! Fuck!

195
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,445
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Janet Marks?

196
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,625
- <i> Yes?</i>
- Hi. This is Officer Will Gorski.

197
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:19,014
- I'm calling about your daughter Nomi.
- <i> Have you found him?</i>

198
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,152
Not yet. The hospital she was admitted to
reported her missing.

199
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,411
I was hoping you might
have some more information.

200
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:26,210
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

201
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:29,265
<i>This isn't the first time</i>
<i>Michael's had problems with the police.</i>

202
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:32,445
Yeah, I'm seeing
some arrests here for hacking,

203
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:34,411
misdemeanor electronic intrusion...

204
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:37,257
<i>Police showing up at our door</i>
<i>at all hours.</i>

205
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:43,784
<i>Michael fell in with bad company,</i>
<i>got infected with all these crazy ideas.</i>

206
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,340
<i>I think all this business</i>
<i>with his brain began</i>

207
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,349
<i>with those hormones he started taking.</i>

208
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:52,110
<i>Most of it is illegal.</i>

209
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:55,792
<i>God only knows</i>
<i>what's really inside that stuff.</i>

210
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:59,056
<i>But, Michael's never been sensible.</i>

211
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,687
- Nomi.
- <i> What?</i>

212
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,822
Not Michael. Her name is Nomi.

213
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:10,437
Hey, hon. Just got a text from Disney.
They're on their way.

214
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,119
You OK?

215
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:19,432
Something happened
when I walked over here, didn't it?

216
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,772
What?

217
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,378
I was looking at the people
and I had this feeling.

218
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:29,977
It was so familiar,
something I've known my entire life.

219
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:34,160
The feeling of being seen and not seen,

220
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:39,223
of being a part of them
and being apart from them.

221
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:45,917
And then I saw you... the first person
that made all of that go away,

222
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:49,391
that made me feel I did fit in,
that I belonged.

223
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,538
I saw you and for a moment...

224
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,722
I didn't know who you were.

225
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:05,834
It feels impossible. What's happening
to me, it feels impossible.

226
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:09,850
Honey, not so long ago,
the idea of someone like me,

227
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:14,327
someone with my crazy thoughts,
my... desires,

228
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,796
someone with this kind of hair...

229
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,726
would've been completely impossible
in this world.

230
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:22,361
Just as there was a time in my life

231
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:25,960
when the idea of me falling in love
with someone like you...

232
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,764
Honestly?

233
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,739
Even I would have said
it was impossible.

234
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:41,399
And yet, there we are,
in that tiny bathroom at the Lexington,

235
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,747
and from the instant my lips
touched these two lips...

236
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:50,646
I realized one of the most important
lessons of my life:

237
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:56,169
impossibility is a kiss away from reality.

238
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,935
He kissed me.

239
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,415
The first time I kissed your father,
oh, dear!

240
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,386
Don't know whether he would
want me to tell you all this.

241
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:20,604
Of course,
because I'm back here cooking,

242
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:23,533
I cannot hear a word you are saying,
my dearest one.

243
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,009
The truth is,
for the longest time,

244
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,486
I thought kissing is as eating a kebab,
because whenever I would kiss,

245
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:36,043
all I would taste
was spices and garlic on his lips.

246
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:38,679
I'm sure that
whatever you are laughing at

247
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,729
would not be at the expense of a man

248
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,076
who would slave for hours making...
shahi tukda.

249
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:47,047
Ooh!

250
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:48,680
Oh, my God.

251
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,358
Kala, you are beautiful.

252
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,747
Thanks, Dad.

253
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:56,964
May I?

254
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:59,391
It's for you.

255
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,349
Mm...

256
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,909
Dad, could you teach Rajan how to make it?

257
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,210
No.

258
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,524
A minute ago,
this tasted like a normal coffee.

259
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,369
Now it tastes like a sugary dessert.

260
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,546
That doesn't sound like a bad thing.

261
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:33,365
What if Dr. Metzger's right and there is
something wrong with my brain?

262
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:36,630
Well, there are two possibilities.

263
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:41,525
Possibility one: He's telling the truth.

264
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,164
There is something wrong with your brain.

265
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:49,809
And it's causing hallucinations
and you're gonna die.

266
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,821
I'm not digging that one.
What's possibility two?

267
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,248
That he's lying.

268
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:58,470
That what he says is happening to you
isn't what's happening.

269
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:01,315
And if that's the case,
there has to be a reason why he's lying,

270
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:04,035
and we need to find out
what that reason is.

271
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:07,634
Don't worry, hon,
we are going to figure this out.

272
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,036
Well done, Van Damme.

273
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:41,483
Come.

274
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,546
What is going on here?

275
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,809
You passed my test.

276
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,068
Why?

277
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,287
I had to know how far you would go.

278
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,358
If you're willing to risk your life for...

279
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:07,885
a pair of coconuts,
then you're the man I need.

280
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,362
I'll be in touch, Van Damme.

281
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:51,859
"Steiner's furious!"

282
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,960
"Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

283
00:26:56,588 --> 00:27:01,901
"There are few things as unpleasant for me
as listening to my own son whine."

284
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:06,001
"Oh, Daddy!

285
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:11,859
Daddy, somebody stole my diamonds.
I want my..."

286
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,830
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, hey. New shirt.

287
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:16,923
Don't ever use that word, understand?

288
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:20,395
Sergei's not stupid. He's watching us.

289
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:23,993
- Sergei doesn't know shit.
- Yeah.

290
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:25,123
If he did, we'd be dead.

291
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:30,729
He was just fucking with you,
trying to see if you knew anything.

292
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,580
Probably had box men coming in all day,
giving them the same routine.

293
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:39,349
He's just shaking the trees.

294
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:43,073
Keep quiet. Stick to the plan.

295
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,751
Got it.

296
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:50,729
"Steiner's furious."

297
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,998
Gotta piss.

298
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,831
Who's there?

299
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:19,182
Is there a woman in here?

300
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,324
What do you mean is there
a woman in here. This is my bathroom.

301
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:29,391
Your bathroom? Lady,
I think you may be even drunker than I am.

302
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,282
I'm not drunk,
though obviously you are!

303
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:43,534
What are you talking about?

304
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,467
I know that voice...

305
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:53,701
Where are you?

306
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:57,675
You are the singing man in my dream.

307
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,349
I can't see you.

308
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,906
Wolfgang?

309
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:06,588
What the hell language is that?

310
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:16,672
Kala? Are you all right?
I heard you talking to someone.

311
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:22,404
Oh, just... to myself.

312
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:24,286
Oh.

313
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:28,219
Well, if you ever need someone
to talk to about things...

314
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,725
Things?

315
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,658
Things that happen
on a girl's wedding night.

316
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,709
Auntie, it's OK.

317
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,599
We have the Internet.

318
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,106
Oh!

319
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,114
I knew that thing
was good for something.

320
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,663
Mm.

321
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:51,902
<i>Am I making my mind up as it happens?</i>

322
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:55,792
- Or do I already know?
- You tell me, baby. You're the guy.

323
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,763
Just make it real.
I want your guts on this one, yes?

324
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,980
I think I should have a line
before I reach Don Carlos.

325
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:03,533
- Sure. Whatever. Put it in. Yes.
- OK.

326
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,583
So we're gonna rehearse
with the squibs, right?

327
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,637
Fuck, no! I want chaos, confusion.

328
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:11,399
I want blanks firing, squibs exploding.

329
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,374
Total mayhem surrounding the meaningless
destruction of precious art.

330
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,344
That's... That's the message of this film.

331
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:21,943
And without the grit of reality,
nobody's going to believe it.

332
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,867
- OK? Your guts?
- OK.

333
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:26,712
Yes! OK, are we ready for this? Nachito!

334
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:29,140
- Bring it on, please. Come on, everybody.
- Bah! Bah!

335
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,825
You won't believe it till you see it
with your own eyes. She's double-jointed.

336
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:37,466
Blows the candles out on a cupcake
stuck in her own ass.

337
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,809
Yeah, she's a real artist.

338
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,064
Uh...

339
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:43,533
I can't. I got paperwork.

340
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:46,629
Oh, you're goin'. It's Miller's 40th.

341
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,093
You have to pay your respects.

342
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:51,692
So, sign the fucking card,<i> pendejo.</i>

343
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,747
Go on and put a twenty in there.

344
00:30:57,801 --> 00:31:00,354
- Holy shit.
- What?

345
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,826
I requested an up-rez
of your photo from last night.

346
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,257
- The kid?
- Yeah, check it out.

347
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,730
Hey, check existing contacts.

348
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:13,867
Checking.

349
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,750
Boom. Name and last known.

350
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,299
Let's go.

351
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:20,897
Oh, I thought you had paperwork to do.

352
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,822
No? No? All right.

353
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,508
- Here they are.
- Oh.

354
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,437
- Mm...
- Hey.

355
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,327
Sorry it took so long.
I just wanted to be sure.

356
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,415
There were cops?

357
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,340
There's one staked out front
of your place.

358
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,935
Every couple of hours, an unmarked car
rolls through the alley.

359
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:42,153
Shit.

360
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,831
Were you able to get hold of Isabella?

361
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:48,638
She said no problem
using her back entrance.

362
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,612
Thank you guys so much.
I know how much trouble this is.

363
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,369
It's not a problem, Nomi.

364
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,718
After what you did for Lola and me?
You're family.

365
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:01,943
Clete Tamark. Couple convictions.

366
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:04,411
Vandalism, disorderly conduct, MIP.

367
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:07,466
He's running with
the New Maniac Mafia up in Englewood.

368
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,441
What happened to the Old Maniac Mafia?
I miss them.

369
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:14,620
He's just a kid, too.

370
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:17,927
They're all kids, Will. They're all kids.

371
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:30,772
Art is like religion.

372
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:33,951
For the believers, it's everything.

373
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,500
For anyone else...

374
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:40,186
it's just a pile of stinking bullshit.

375
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,044
I know you.

376
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:09,726
Do I know you?

377
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,408
This is not who you are.

378
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,612
Clete! Cops!

379
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:23,701
Kill him!

380
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,885
Oh, shit!

381
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:32,068
Shit! Fuck!

382
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,161
Hey! Stop!

383
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,048
Boy, you better stop!

384
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:52,278
I fuckin' hate this shit!

385
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:16,797
Ah!

386
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:23,031
- Fuck!
- Get up, get up! Go, go, go!

387
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,269
- Kick me. Kick me.
- What?

388
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,651
Kick me.

389
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,718
Y'all smell pork?

390
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,658
You in the wrong 'hood, po-po.

391
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,838
- Get yo' bacon-smellin' ass on.
- You motherfuckers on a coffee break?

392
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:28,512
Yeah, with yo' mama.

393
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,274
All right.

394
00:35:31,944 --> 00:35:35,291
What's wrong with this nig...?
Bye-bye!

395
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:38,513
OK, we're gonna have some fun.

396
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:43,700
- Fucking cut!
- How was it?

397
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:47,089
I've got a hard-on
that's gonna last all week!

398
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,273
Oh, so natural, so real!

399
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,118
- Bra-vo! Bravo!
- Yes, yes, yes!

400
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,666
Yes!

401
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,754
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

402
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,930
I apologize. I'm sorry, man.

403
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:01,231
- That's in the movie.
- Yeah?

404
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:03,323
- That's in the movie, Lito!
- It's in the movie?

405
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:04,705
- Yes! Come on!
- Thank you.

406
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,562
Where am I? Where is this?

407
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,026
Nairobi.

408
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,617
Where are you?

409
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,926
Seoul.

410
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:44,872
- You speak Korean?
- Do you speak Swahili?

411
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:49,181
Then how are we understanding each other?

412
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,605
I don't know.

413
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:56,754
You are the spirit of Jean-Claude.

414
00:37:56,755 --> 00:38:00,185
I felt your spirit in me.

415
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:01,817
You are a very good fighter.

416
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:04,244
You don't know anything about me.

417
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:08,722
I don't know how,
but I know your name is Sun.

418
00:38:10,144 --> 00:38:13,993
- You have a difficult decision to make.
- Stop. This cannot be real.

419
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:16,168
What is real is I might have died
if it wasn't for you.

420
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,758
I don't understand this.

421
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:22,571
So if you do not mind,
I prefer to assume you're a hallucination.

422
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,164
I take no offense.

423
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:28,972
Since that is resolved,
I would like to continue my walk.

424
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,813
Please.

425
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,864
- Alone.
- Of course.

426
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,227
- You're still here.
- I'm sorry.

427
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,738
I don't know how I came here
or how I go back.

428
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,252
Perhaps there is something in me
that calls or something in you that calls.

429
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,387
I'm not calling you or anyone else.

430
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,107
Perhaps that is the problem.

431
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:04,872
Are you in trouble?

432
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,312
No. But tomorrow I might be.

433
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,433
I know this choice.

434
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:33,408
It's like having two different lives.

435
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,588
One will be very dangerous for me.

436
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,646
The other, very bad for my mother.

437
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:49,516
My question is, am I the person
who wants to see my brother punished,

438
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:54,119
who wants to watch the business
my father built be destroyed?

439
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:58,888
Or am I the person
who wants to save them,

440
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,022
who will go to prison for them,

441
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:05,458
even though they have been cruel to me
for my entire life?

442
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,805
You are afraid.

443
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,952
I feel it for my mother every day.

444
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:18,554
I promised I would take care of her.

445
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,153
Everything will be all right...

446
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,249
I must keep that promise.

447
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:29,224
I must keep it, no matter what.

448
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:35,499
I promised my mother
I would protect my family.

449
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,767
It was the last thing I said to her
before she died.

450
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:43,492
- If I break it...
- Then your last words become a lie.

451
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:52,404
Once, when I was eight...

452
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,174
my father's enemies came to our house.

453
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,483
They had big machetes, like this.

454
00:41:02,404 --> 00:41:04,495
My mother had a knife, like this.

455
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,633
<i>They wanted revenge</i>
<i>for what my father's tribe had done.</i>

456
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,934
<i>They wanted me.</i>

457
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:13,241
<i>My father was gone. She was alone.</i>

458
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:20,103
<i>But... she put me behind her,</i>
<i>and she faced these men.</i>

459
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,696
<i>They knew they could kill her.</i>

460
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:26,671
<i>But they also looked her</i>
<i>in the eyes and knew</i>

461
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:30,269
<i>she would take</i>
<i>at least one of them with her.</i>

462
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,111
And they left.

463
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,918
Because none of them
wanted to be that one.

464
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,704
Who can say if it is
we who make the choice,

465
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:46,839
or the choice that makes us?

466
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:10,311
...the ceremony.
The last thing we would...

467
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:13,156
The color's
really looking nice on her.

468
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:16,127
- Think it shows the right...
- Where did you have it made?

469
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:19,558
- The same tailor we normally use?
- I had no idea how heavy it all would be.

470
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:25,290
I hope I don't collapse
in the middle of the circle.

471
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:31,818
Priya!

472
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:40,855
Priya, I don't want to
pressure anyone, but...

473
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:43,659
- Sanyam, please!
- All right, all right. Take your time.

474
00:45:45,082 --> 00:45:49,140
I take the first of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be...

475
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:56,796
that we may cherish each other
and promise that we will grow together...

476
00:45:56,797 --> 00:46:00,646
<i>in mental and spiritual strength.</i>

477
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:06,170
I take the fourth
of the seven steps with you...

478
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:12,738
I take the fifth of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be,

479
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:16,170
and promise love and obedience
in all things.

480
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:30,772
I take the sixth of the seven steps
with you, my wife-to-be...

481
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:35,081
with the promise of
everlasting companionship.

482
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:46,043
We shall share love.

483
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:48,680
Share the same tastes.

484
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,077
Share the same food.

485
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,877
The final vow, the final step,
is yours, my love.

486
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:46,588
Let us make a vow together
to share our strengths.

487
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:04,705
We shall be of one mind.

488
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:18,303
We shall observe these vows together.

489
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:28,471
Come thou, as I take the last
of seven steps with you and...

490
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,471
What the fuck are you doing?

491
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:41,902
You're not in love with him.

492
00:48:44,077 --> 00:48:47,298
Kala? Kala?
