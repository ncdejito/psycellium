Will,Noth... I'm just talking to myself.,
,,
,You were at the shooting last night?,
,,
Metzger,You've killed us all.,
,,
Will,The only reason they would do something,
,like that is if they felt threatened.,
,,
,That means we're getting close.,
,,
Nomi,It also means that if they have,

,,
,then they'll have no problem killing us.,

Police Captain,"Look, Gorski, this isn't a movie",
,or a fucking TV show.,
,,
,I gave you clear warning,
,"that if you didn't follow orders,",
,,
,there would be consequences.,
Will,"OK, but, can I explain?",
,,
Police Captain,"I can explain,",
,same way they explained it to me.,
,,
,You're suspended without pay.,
,,
Will,Captain.,
,,
,"Captain, you know that is not fair.",
,,
Police Captain,"What the fuck you talkin' about, Gorski?",
,,
,Not fair?,
,,
,This is the real fuckin' world.,
,,
,Nothin's fair.,
,,
,"Drop your badge, sign the paperwork,",
,get the fuck out.,

Henchman,It's El CaÃ­do.,
,,
Mourner,You said he would come for you.,
,,
Actress,A man must never be judged,
,"by the length of his gun,",
,,
,or the size of his fortune.,
,,
Lito,"In the end, we'll all be judged",
,by the courage of our hearts.,
,,
Director,And cut!,
,,
Lito,"Give me one more, please. The line!",
,,
Director,"Lito, you're beautiful.",
,,
Lito,You sure?,
Director,"It's great, we're fine.",
,,
,"We have it, OK?",
,,
,"And your, uh... friend is here.",
,,
Lito,"Oh, yeah. My bodyguard. Yeah.",

Manendra,"Hello, Kala.",
Kala,Papa-ji.,
,,
,I had no idea you came to the temple.,
Manendra,I don't.,
,,
,"No, I came here to see you.",
,,
,Can I have a word with you?,
Kala,"Yes, of course.",
,,
Manendra,I was considering our conversation,
,about continuing the wedding as planned.,
,,
,"It's just that, uh,",
,the events of the past few days,
,,
,have led me to... reconsider things.,
,,
Kala,Reconsider?,
Manendra,Yes.,
,,
,"You know, I don't believe in",
,gods and miracles.,
,,
,Our fates are governed,
,by the choices that we make.,
,,
,"Others, of course, will argue that luck,",
,"good or bad, is a factor, but I disagree.",
,,
,Luck can only offer an opportunity.,
,,
,But without the will,
,"to make the right choice,",
,,
,luck would be as meaningless as...,
,as that elephant-headed god.,
,,
,"To me, the idea of praying to a god",
,to somehow influence my own fate,
,,
,is both primitive and terribly sad.,
,,
Kala,"I'm sorry, I don't think this is the place",
,to have this conversation.,

Lito,Something's wrong?,
,,
,"What is it? Is it Joaquin, right?",
,,
,He's gonna blackmail me.,
Hernando,No.,
,,
,"No, no, I haven't heard from him.",
,,
Lito,Is it Daniela?,
,,
Hernando,In a way.,
,,
,"I guess, in a way, she reminded me of",
,the things I had allowed myself to forget,
,,
,because I feel so strongly about you.,
,,
Lito,"Hernando, your tone is scaring me.",
,What are you talking about?,
,,
Hernando,"I love you, Lito.",
,,
,I love you more than I have ever,
,loved anyone in my life.,
,,
Lito,"I love you, too.",
,,
Hernando,But I can't be with someone,
,who allows someone else to be hurt,
,,
,in order to protect their career.,
,,
,I wish it didn't end this way.,
Lito,It doesn't end this way.,
,,
,What are you talking about?,
,This isn't my fault.,
,,
,"Hernando, she did this to herself.",
,She admitted it.,
,,
,You cannot leave me for that.,
,This is not fair.,
,,
Hernando,I know it's not fair.,
Lito,So what do you want me to do?,
,,
,You want me to throw,
,my whole life down the toilet,
,,
,because of a woman I barely know?,
Hernando,"I don't know what you should do, Lito.",
,,
,All I know is what I have to do.,
,,
Lito,Are you gonna break up with me,
,because of her?,
,,
Hernando,"No, it's not her.",
Lito,Then what?,
,,
Hernando,"""In the end...",
,,
,we will all be judged,
,"by the courage of our hearts.""",
,,
Lito,It's a stupid line from a stupid movie.,
,"Hernando, please.",
,,
Hernando,"I'm sorry, Lito.",
,,
,Goodbye.,
Lito,"No, please, no. Please don't leave me.",
,,
,Hernando.,
,,
,Hernando.,
,,
,Hernando!,
,,
,"Hernando, please don't leave me, please.",
,,
Director,Here we go. Let's shoot!,

Manendra,I was hoping that after,
,"our conversation is over,",
,,
,"when you pray to your Ganesha,",
,,
,he'll also tell you that what you are,
,going to do is the right thing to do.,
,,
Kala,What I am going to do?,
Manendra,Mm.,
,,
,You are going to call up my son,
,,
,and you are going to tell him,
,that you cannot marry him.,
,,
Kala,What?,
,,
Manendra,You know in your heart,
,that's the right thing to do.,
,,
,I could see it in your eyes.,
,,
,"That's why you stopped the wedding,",
,,
,to keep yourself from,
,committing this terrible mistake.,
,,
Kala,That's not true. That is not why I...,
Manendra,Of course... Of course it is true.,
,,
Kala,I...,
Manendra,It was a mistake for both our parts.,
,,
,I should have never given my blessing.,
,,
,"But now, luck has given us",
,another opportunity to correct it.,
,,
,All we require is the will...,
,,
Kala,No!,
,,
,Help!,
,,
,Help!,
,,
,Papa-ji!,
,,
,Papa-ji!,
,,
,Papa-ji?,
,,
,Help! Help!,
,,
,Somebody! Help!,
