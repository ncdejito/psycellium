Will,OK.,

,,
Nurse,Can I ask you a personal question?,

,,
,how you gonna feel about that?,
,,1
Nyx,You all right?,
,,
,You're sweating.,
,,
,Your pulse is racing.,

,,
Nyx,You're scared.,
,,
,You needn't be.,
,,
,You're so beautiful.,
,,
,I don't just mean in a physical way.,
,,
,The warmth... pouring out of your heart.,
,,
,Even though you work hard to hide it.,
,,
,You don't belong with these men.,
,,
,You know it's true.,
,,
,Don't you?,
,,
,I used to be like you.,
,,
,Like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth.,
,,
,I used anything I could to insulate.,
,,
,Music... books... booze.,
,,
,Anything I could to keep myself,
,separate from the rest of the world.,
,,
,"Eventually I felt protected,",
,"you know, I...",
,,
,I felt safe.,
,,
,But also...,
,,
,I never felt so... completely alone.,
,,
,"Then one day a friend, she gave me a gift.",
,,
,She took away my armor.,
,,
,She tore down my walls.,
,,
,Her gift... it reminded me,
,,
,what it felt like... to be alive.,
,,
Riley,What did she give you?,
,,
Nyx,This.,

Diego,"Ah, hell no.",
,,
Will,This wasn't a dream.,
,,
Diego,"Of all the partners,",
,I end up with a Mulder-wannabe.,
,,
Will,"D, a woman killed herself right here.",
Diego,"Where's the blood, Will?",
,,
,Maybe she only shot herself,
,"in the fifth dimension,",
,,
,so we can't see the blood.,
,,
Will,"OK, I've never been here before.",
,,
,I know about this.,
,,
,Drugs.,
,,
,"There's a gun, too.",
,,
Diego,"There's shit everywhere, man.",
,,
,"Look, you're freakin' me out.",
,,
,"Show me evidence of a crime,",
,and you got me.,

Riley,Why are you doing this?,
,,
Jacks,"He has just had a shipment come in,",
,and me and Nocker have been trackin' it.,
,,
,"We were gonna hit him yesterday,",
,but he wanted you here.,
,,
,Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.,
,,
,"Now, a smart guy like you...",
,probably has a gun in there.,
,,
Riley,Don't hurt him.,
Jacks,"Oh, yeah.",
,,
,Is that why you came? 'Cause you wanna...,
,Do you wanna fuck him?,
,,
,"Riles, he will kill you without blinking",
,if I didn't have this.,
,,
,I fuckin' told you. Here.,
Riley,I have to go.,
,,
Jacks,"No, no, no, no, no. Riley. You're not...",
,You're not going anywhere.,
,,
,"You're part of this. No, no, no.",
Riley,Let me go.,
,,
Jacks,"Riles, Riles... this is the break",
,that we've been waiting for.,
,,
,Fill it up.,
,,
,Fill it up!,
,,
,"Riles, this is our chance.",
