Nomi,"It was the same woman from my dream,",
,I'm sure of it. The same face.,
,,
Neets,You gotta stop watching all those,
,cop shows. They will mess you up.,
,,
Nomi,"I feel like I know her,",
,I just don't remember from where.,
,,
Neets,Maybe someone from your criminal past.,
,,
Nomi,I wasn't a criminal.,
Neets,No. Activist.,
,,
Nomi,Hacktivist.,
,,
,"Reformed, paroled, legal.",
Neets,Uh-huh.,
,,
,And what about all these,
,security companies that you hack for?,
,,
Nomi,"Well, it's not hacking",
,if you get paid for it.,
,,
,"Anyway, I thought I knew her",
,"from one of my client companies,",
,,
,"but no, that's not it.",
,,
Neets,You've led a lot of different lives.,
,,
Nomi,So have you.,
Neets,Me?,
,,
,I've been working at the same bookstore,
,"since you met me,",
,,
,but not for much longer,
,if I don't shake my ass.,
,,
Nomi,"Oh... Wait, wait.",
,,
,"OK, but tell me honestly,",
,am I sounding crazy?,
,,
Neets,Maybe you should write about it.,
,,
Nomi,I am.,
,,
Neets,"Well, it is that time of year.",
,You always go a little crazy at Pride.,
,,
Nomi,You know why.,
,,
Neets,"Honey, if I had your parents,",
,I'd be more than a little crazy.,
,,
,I'd be homicidal.,
Nomi,Mm.,

Deshawn,You got a funny look,
,"in your eye, Will.",
,,
,You hot for me or somethin'?,
,,
,"I know I'm USDA prime cut,",
,,
,but you should know,
,I don't swing that way.,
,,
Will,Thanks for clearing that up.,
,,
Deshawn,Ain't gonna be good for my rep,
,having no 5-0 sittin' bedside.,
,,
Will,"Yeah, it's not helping me much either.",
,,
Deshawn,So you think you own me now,
,or somethin'?,
,,
Will,No...,
,,
,What I did for you,
,I would've done for anybody.,
,,
Deshawn,"So what, then?",
,,
Will,I was just thinking about,
,what you said in the car...,
,,
,about your dad being shot.,
,,
Deshawn,Long time ago.,
,,
,Things ain't no different.,
,,
Will,My dad was shot.,
,,
Deshawn,Dead?,
,,
Will,Some parts of him.,
,Finished his career.,

,Hey! Hey!,

,This fuckin' kid.,
,,
Deshawn,You picked the lock?,

Will,My dad was always workin'.,
,I was always waitin'.,

,Not much else to play with,

Deshawn,"Yeah, Will, you know",

Will,All right.,

Nomi,"I've been thinking about my life,",
,,
,and all of the mistakes that I've made.,
,,
,"The ones that stay with me,",
,"the ones that I regret,",
,,
,are the ones that I made,
,because of fear.,
,,
,"For a long time,",
,I was afraid to be who I am,
,,
,because I was taught by my parents,
,,
,that there's something wrong,
,with someone like me.,
,,
,"Something offensive,",
,"something you would avoid,",
,,
,maybe even pity.,
,,
,Something that you could never love.,
,,
,"My mom, she's a fan",
,of St. Thomas Aquinas.,
,,
,She calls pride a sin.,
,,
,"And of all the venal and mortal sins,",
,,
,St. Thomas saw pride,
,as the queen of the seven deadlies.,
,,1
Felix,Wolfgang!,
,,1
Nomi,He saw it as the ultimate gateway sin,
,,
,that would turn you quickly,
,into a sinaholic.,
,,1
Felix,The greatest box man in the world!,
,,1
Nomi,But hating isn't a sin on that list.,
,,
,Neither is shame.,
,,1
Will,"Come on, Dad. Time to go.",
,,1
Nomi,I was afraid of this parade,
,because I wanted so badly,
,,
,to be a part of it.,
,,
,"So today,",
,I'm marching for that part of me,
,,
,that was once too afraid to march.,
,,
,And for all the people,
,who can't march...,
,,
,the people living lives like I did.,
,,
,"Today, I march to remember",
,that I'm not just a me.,
,,
,I'm also a we.,
,,
,And we march with pride.,
,,
,"So go fuck yourself, Aquinas.",
,,
Neets,"Hell, yeah!",
,,
,You OK back there?,
,,
Teagan,"Mom, she's up.",
Janet,"Oh, thank God.",
,,
,I was sure he was gonna,
,be in a coma the rest of my life.,
,,
Nurse,"How you feeling, Michael?",
,,
Nomi,My name is Nomi.,
,,
Nurse,"Oh, I'm sorry.",
,Your mother's been calling you Michael.,
,,
Janet,What kind of name is Nomi?,
,,
,Have you ever heard,
,of anyone named Nomi?,
,,
,You were Michael,
,"before you came out of me,",
,,
,and you will be Michael,
,until they put me in my grave.,
,,
Teagan,"Mom, come on. She almost died.",
,,
Janet,Serves you right.,
,,
,You shouldn't be riding on motorcycles.,
,,
,Do you know how many people a year,
,die on those things?,
,,
Nomi,Where's Amanita?,
,,
Janet,She left.,
,,
Nomi,She wouldn't have left me.,
,,
Janet,This hospital only allows family,
,into critical care.,
,,
Nomi,She is my family.,
,,
Janet,"Please, Michael, this isn't your blog.",
,,
,This is your life.,
,,
Nomi,I think that you should go.,
,,
Janet,I'm not going anywhere.,
,,
,I'm your mother and I love you.,
,,
,"It may be on my terms, but I do,",
,,
,so I'm not leaving here,
,until you talk to Dr. Metzger.,
,,
,You still want me to go,
,after he tells you what he told us...,
,,
,then I promise I will leave you alone.,
,,1
Will,I'm not crazy.,
,,
Diego,Didn't say you were.,
Will,"Yeah, but...",
,,
,"You didn't believe me either, not about",
,"the woman, the building, the stash,",
,,
,none of it.,
,Maybe you'll believe a camera.,
,,
,Building across the street,
,has got a CTV.,
,,
,I requisitioned the file.,
,,
,This camera's got a perfect view,
,of the front and back.,
,,
,"Anybody pulled a body out,",
,we'll see it.,
,,
,"OK, this is about the time we pulled over",
,,
,because I thought,
,"I saw that woman, right?",
,,
Diego,"Ooh, the blond ghost in her underwear.",
,,
Will,I think she visited me last night.,
,,
,"All right, here it is.",
,,
,What the hell?,
,,
,This has been erased.,
,,
,Somebody erased two hours of this.,
Diego,That is weird.,
,,
Will,"Man, D, something is going on here.",
,,
Diego,I'll give you there's definitely,
,a flag on the play.,
,,
,"Hey, yo. Check out our man here.",
,,
Will,Uh-huh.,
,,
,He saw the whole thing.,

Metzger,"This is what a normal,",
,healthy brain looks like:,
,,
,"two distinct,",
,well-differentiated frontal lobes.,
,,
,The problem begins here in,
,the substantia alba of the frontal lobe.,
,,
,These two masses,
,are growing into one another.,
,,
Janet,You see? There's no separation.,
,,
Metzger,It's often misdiagnosed,
,"as acute encephalitis,",
,,
,but it's a condition called UFLS:,
,undifferentiated frontal lobe syndrome.,
,,
Nomi,All acronyms are scary.,
Metzger,Yeah.,
,,
,"I'll be honest with you, Nomi, is it?",
,,
,It's not good.,
,,
,"There is a procedure to treat UFLS,",
,,
,but it requires,
,a very aggressive surgery,
,,
,where we go in,
,and try to cut away the growth.,
,,
,"Oh, my God.",
,,
Janet,The surgery is also incredibly expensive.,
,,
,You're going to need to use our insurance.,
,,
Teagan,Mom.,
Janet,"These are just the facts, Teagan.",
,,
Nomi,And if I don't have the surgery?,
,,
Metzger,"Without the surgery,",
,the tissue will continue to metastasize.,
,,
,Patients will begin to experience,
,a deterioration of mental faculties.,
,,
,It's common for them,
,"to experience very intense,",
,,
,very real hallucinations and synesthesia,
,that precedes a loss of memory,
,,
,and a complete occlusion of identity.,
,,
Janet,He told us if he didn't,
,"operate immediately,",
,,
,you could be dead within six months.,
Teagan,"Jesus Christ, Mom!",
,,
Janet,"You understand now, Michael?",
,You're going to need us.,
,,
,You're going to need your family.,
Nomi,Don't touch me! You are not my family!,
,,
Metzger,We should go.,
Janet,"This is for your own good, Michael.",
,,
Nomi,Don't call me that!,
,,
Janet,You're my child. I love you.,
Nomi,Go!,
,,
,Just... Just go.,

Rajan,"Well, the truth is,",
,"she never even looked at me, not once.",

,"I felt like a stalker,",
,waiting in the cafeteria,
,,
,for a chance to ask her out.,
,,
,I was sure that she didn't like me.,
,,
,But my father taught me,

Daniela,"No, no, no, but you make it work.",
,You carry us through.,
,,
,"I mean, there's only like one,",
,maybe two problems.,
,,
Lito,What?,
,,
Daniela,She's horrible. Horrible.,
Lito,Come on.,
,,
Daniela,"Don't know what's more fake,",
,her acting or her tits.,
,,
,"No, seriously...",
Lito,You're terrible.,
,,
Daniela,"No, you don't even worry",
,"when the ship goes down,",
,,
,you know she's going to float away,
,safely on those things.,
,,
,"And afterward, she came up to you",
,and you told her how great she was.,
,,
,How do you even do that?,
,,
Lito,"You know, you just look them",
,right in the eye and you lie.,
,,
,It's what we do. It's called acting.,
,,
Daniela,Speaking of...,
,,
,would you like to come upstairs and...,
,run some lines with me?,
,,
Lito,I can't. I have an early call tomorrow.,
,,
Daniela,Really?,

Sanyam,They say the only thing people,
,remember about a wedding is the food.,
,,
,Yes.,
Rajan,"Well, if it's going to be as good",

Hernando,And what did Ms. Velasquez,
,have to say about it?,
,,
Lito,It was fun.,
Hernando,Hm.,
,,
,Let me guess. She was complaining,
,the whole night about Ana's breasts.,
,,
,But you didn't pick her because of,

Lito,"No, no.",
,I have someone else for that.,

Hernando,"Well, it's... it's quite good.",
Lito,Come on.,

Daniela,This is gonna be perfect.,

,This...,

,"I mean, you obviously",

,and part of you,
,already knows this is true.,
,,
,"We all know when people are lying to us,",
,we just don't want to listen.,
,,
,"The minute Metzger entered this room,",
,a voice inside of you told you to run.,
,,
,Right now you need to listen,
,"to that voice, and get out of here.",
,,
Nomi,Uh...,
,,
,Hello?,
,,
,"Amanita, is that you?",
,,
,"Oh, my God.",
,,
,I... I'm losing my mind.,
,,1
Bar guy,You got some sack of balls,
,comin' in here.,
,,
Mike,"Hey, he's still my kid.",
,,
Bar guy 2,"After what he did,",
,I'd disown the fuck.,
,,
Will,Can I talk to you?,
,,
Mike,You buyin'?,
Will,"Yeah, sure.",
,,
Mike,Round for everybody.,
,All right.,
,,
,Step into my office.,
,,
Bar guy,I ain't drinkin' no traitor beer.,
Bar guy 2,I'll take his.,
,,
Bar guy,What?,
Bar guy 2,Beer is innocent. It don't take sides.,
,,
Bar guy,You take my beer and I'll fuck you up.,
,,
Mike,This goddamn thing's been,
,givin' me grief all day.,
,,
,"Do me a favor, Willy,",
,go take a shit for me.,
,,
Will,"Yeah, I get it. You're pissed off",
,'cause I did my job.,
,,
,"I tried to save that kid's life, Dad.",
,I'm just... I'm gonna go.,
,,
Mike,What? Sit down!,
,,
,"God, you never had a sense of humor.",
,,
,Come on.,
,,
,You did what you felt,
,was the right thing.,
,,
,I'm proud of you for that.,
,,
,But if this punk,
,"ends up killin' somebody,",
,,
,"well then,",
,"you gotta live with that, not me.",
,,
,But you know that.,
,,
,You didn't come all the way down here,
,to talk about that.,
,,
Will,"This isn't easy to say, but I...",
,,
,I think you might be,
,the only one who's gonna believe me.,
,,
,"Something's going on, Dad,",
,,
,and I think it's got somethin',
,to do with Sara Patrell.,
,,
Mike,"Oh, boy.",
,,
,You're actually out of your fuckin' mind.,
,,
Will,I'm beginning to wonder.,
,,
Mike,"Look, forget about what you did",
,with that gangbanger.,
,,
,Forget about what these guys,
,might think of you.,
,,
,"If you bring this girl up,",
,"you start talkin' about her again,",
,,
,they'll drag you into psych evaluation,
,over the next six months.,
,,
,They'll run you off this force,
,,
,quicker than you could,
,scrape dog shit off your shoe.,
,,
,"Let her go, Willy. Let her go.",
,,1
Nomi,Don't.,
,,
,It's just in your head.,
,Don't answer it.,
,,
,Hello?,
,,
Neets,"Oh, my God, it worked!",
,,
, I found you finally.,
Nomi,Amanita?,
,,
Neets,"I knew they had you on 18,",
,so I tried every room.,
,,
Nomi,"Oh, my God, where are... Where are you?",
,,
Neets,Here in the hospital.,
,They wouldn't let me see you.,
,,
,"There's a ton of security on your floor,",
,but I knew Lola worked here,
,,
,and she gave me her code.,
Lola,"Gotta be quick, Neets.",
,,
Neets,"Listen, Nom,",
,I saw your crazy bitch mother.,
,,
,I don't know what she thinks,
,"she's doing here, but...",
,,
Nomi,It's not just her.,
,There's this doctor.,
,,
Neets,"Yeah, Metzger.",
,He signed your papers.,
,,
Nomi,He said that there's,
,something wrong with my brain.,
,,
,"And Neets,",
,bad things have been happening.,
,,
Neets,What things?,
,,
Nomi,I've been hearing things,
,and feeling things and seeing things.,
,,
,"Neets, I'm so scared.",
,,
Neets,It's gonna be OK.,
,Something is going on.,
,,
,"I don't know what it is,",
,"but until we do,",
,,
,I will burn this building down before,
,I let anyone touch that beautiful brain.,
,,
Nomi,"God, I love you.",
,,
,But what if he's right?,
,,
,Metzger said that I wouldn't,
,be able to tell the difference,
,,
,"between a hallucination and reality,",
,"and Neets,",
,,
,"I saw the guy from my dream,",
,the one that I told you about.,
,,
,He was at the parade and...,
,and he was here in my room.,
,,
Neets,Persian guy? Leather jacket?,
,,
Nomi,Did I tell you that?,
Neets, No.,
,,
,You were taking pictures,
,before you fainted.,
,,
,I got your phone here.,
,,
,"Cameras don't hallucinate,",
,and that guy is staring right at you.,
,,
Lola,We gotta go. We gotta go now.,
Neets,"I'm gonna get you outta here, Nomi.",
,,
,I love you.,
,,
Nomi,"I love you, too.",

Will,"Hey, excuse me?",
,I'm just having some trouble sleeping.,
,,
,What kind of sleeping pills you guys sell?,
,,
Store guy,Somulex.,
,,
,"That's my drug, bro.",
,,
,"With a shot of bourbon,",
,totally knocks me out. Bam!,
,,
,But don't tell anyone,
,"I told you that, 'cause like,",
,,
,you're not supposed,
,to take liquor with it.,
,,
,But I totally dig the buzz.,
,,
,And it gives me major fucked up dreams.,
,,
Will,Fucked up dreams I got plenty of.,
,,
Store guy,Sure.,
,,
,"We used to do these training courses,",
,,
,and they taught us,
,that drugs are like shoes.,
,,
,"Everyone needs them,",
,but they don't always fit.,
,,
Will,Hm.,
Store guy,Second aisle to the left.,
,,
Jonas,Hello.,
,,
,My name is Jonas.,
,,
Will,I know who you are.,
,,
Jonas,"You know what they told you, and you",
,know what your senses are telling you.,
,,
,"The question is, Will,",
,which of the two are you going to trust?,
,,
Will,How do you know my name?,
,,
Jonas,She told me.,
Will,Who?,
,,
Jonas,"Angelica, the woman",
,"that gave birth to you,",
,,
,just before she took her life.,
,,
Will,She shot herself.,
,,
Jonas,We all experience many births,
,and deaths during a life...,
,,
,but few know what it means,
,to be reborn a sensate.,
,,
Will,A what?,
Jonas,You have a migraine.,
,,
,You've had it since you saw her.,
,,
,It will last for several more days.,
,,
,"When mine finally ended,",
,"I cried like a baby,",
,,
,but that's just the beginning.,
,,
,You will start to feel strange things.,
,,
,You will feel snow,
,"in the middle of the summer,",
,,
,rain when there isn't,
,a cloud in the sky.,
,,
,You'll feel anger and joy and pain.,
,,
,Pleasure without any reason.,
,,
Will,Excuse me. Excuse me.,
,Do you see this guy?,
,,
Jonas,"I don't have much time, Will.",
,,
,There's a plane leaving in an hour,
,and I have to be on it.,
,,
Will,"No, you're not going anywhere.",
,,
Jonas,"There is a girl in San Francisco,",
,Nomi Marks.,
,,
,"She needs your help,",
,just like Sara Patrell needed your help.,
,,
Will,I'm still a cop. I can't let you go.,
,,
Jonas,"I'm not the enemy, Will.",
,,
Will,Quite a few governments,
,including this one says you are.,
,,
Jonas,You're about to go for the gun strapped,
,"to your ankle, but by the time you do,",
,,
,the fight will be over.,
,,
Store guy,"Not cool, man.",
,Should I call the cops?,
,,
Will,I am a cop.,
,,
Jonas,"Don't do this, Will.",
Will,What the fuck?!,
,,
Jonas,You've spent your life trying,
,to understand what happened to you.,
,,
,"If you don't let me go,",
,you might never find out.,
,,
Will,"Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.",
Jonas,"No, it's just expanding.",
,,
,Well done.,
,,
,"Yes, the connection flows both ways,",
,which raises the question:,
,,
,"If you're here,",
,who's driving back there?,
