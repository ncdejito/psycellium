Nomi,I could hack into the hospital,

,,
Neets,Is that the cop?,
Nomi,Yeah.,
,,
Will,I was suspended.,

Nomi,Great.,

,like a Post-it note on a refrigerator.,
,,
,"For instance, when they confiscate",
,"illegal electronic equipment,",
,,
,it's inventoried to a site...,

,that's like a shopping list,

,"So-- Thank you, baby.",
,,
,So when I saw exactly the things,
,"that I had just sold you posted,",

,well... the Bug suspected foul play.,

Nomi,"Oh, I-- I don't have",

Rajan,(Rajan) The doctors are saying,
,it's a miracle he's still alive.,
,,
,I'm not sure which,
,would upset my father more:,
,,
,"the idea of fanatics trying to kill him,",

,or a god getting credit for saving him.,
,,
Kala,How is your mother?,

Rajan,"As he improves, she becomes convinced...",
,that it's because she's praying again.,

,She wants to go to the temple with you.,

Kala,Rajan? I know you,

,,
Rajan,"It's actually nice to get outside,",
,,
,so thank you.,
,,
,Though I am a little nervous about,
,,
,what you've been wanting to talk about.,
,,
Kala,It's about... something I didn't,
,tell the police when they questioned me,
,,
,about the attack on your father.,
,,
,It had no bearing on what happened.,
,It was... a private matter.,
,,
,"As such,",
,I felt that I should tell only you.,
,,
,Your father did not want us,
,to get married.,
,,
,He told me that he had reconsidered,
,"and asked me to say no to you,",
,,
,for your own good.,
,,
,He thought that we were not well matched.,
,,
Rajan,What did you say?,
,,
Kala,There was no time,
,to say very much of anything.,
,,
Rajan,How difficult it must have been,
,for you to hold all this inside.,
,,
Kala,I thought it was important,
,for you to know.,
,,
Rajan,A lesser woman would have said,
,"he wished us well,",
,,
,that he wanted us,
,to be married no matter what...,
,,
,and he gave us his blessings.,
,,
,And I would have known that she was lying.,
,,
Kala,You knew he was against our marriage?,
,,
Rajan,Of course.,
,,
Kala,So is that what I was to you?,
,,
,An act of rebellion against your father?,
Rajan,Never.,
,,
Kala,I told you the truth.,
,,
Rajan,Maybe it added a bit of spice,
,"to my attraction to you,",
,,
,but it has nothing to do,
,with why I asked you to marry me.,
,,
,"I want you to marry me,",
,"not to be for or against anyone else,",
,,
,"because I love you,",
,I trust you...,
,,
,and I can imagine no better life,
,than growing old with you.,
,,
,All I need to know now is...,
,,
,"after everything that has happened,",
,do you still want to marry me?,
