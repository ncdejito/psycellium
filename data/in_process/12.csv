Psychiatrist,(man) Why do you keep,
,"looking out the window, Will?",
,,
,You like the snow?,
,,
,"You know, for some people,",
,snow brings on a very specific feeling.,
,,
,"Uh, some love it.",
,,
,"It feels clean and pure, like a...",
,fresh start or a beginning.,
,,
,"For others, it's frightening.",
,,
,Cold and silent and... isolating.,
,,
,What are you thinking about,
,when you look at the snow?,
,,
Will,That I'm gonna have to shovel it.,
,,
Psychiatrist,(soft chuckle),
,,
,"Will, I'm gonna talk to you...",
,"like I would talk to an adult,",
,,
,because I think,
,you're a very intelligent young man,
,,
,and you are capable,
,of understanding what I'm saying.,
,,
,"In group dynamics, there's something",
,"psychologists call ""savior behavior.""",
,,
,Often one person in the group feels...,
,,
,like they need to save the others,
,from a threat or an emotion,
,,
,that he or she believes is dangerous.,
,,
,Sometimes those people... are children,
,of parents with drug and alcohol problems.,
,,
,These people have had to...,
,save themselves,
,,
,from the emotional consequences,
,of their parents' addiction.,
,,
,Your father was unable,
,to find Sara Patrell,
,,
,"and you wanted to help him, didn't you?",
,,
,And that's a perfectly,
,"normal response, Will.",
,,
,"You wanted to help,",
,that's a good thing.,
,,
,But sometimes when we try to help,
,"one person, another person gets hurt.",
,,
,"Sometimes that person's ourselves,",
,sometimes it's someone else.,
,,
,And I know your intentions...,
,"weren't to hurt anyone,",
,,
,but when you say you can see Sara...,
,,
,"or her ghost and talk to her,",
,,
,it causes people a lot of pain.,
,,
,"Especially Sara's parents,",
,,
,who are dealing with the worst thing,
,a parent can go through.,
,,
,"Now, I've been as honest",
,"as I can with you, Will.",
,,
,Can you do the same for me?,
,,
,Are you still seeing Sara?,
,,
Sarah,Shh.,
,,
Will,No.,

Will,Seriously?,
,,
Nomi,It's a square-cube law thing.,
,,
,"Bigger and more high tech a company is,",
,the easier it is to use the front door.,
,,
Will,What about Riley?,
,,
Nomi,I assume since none of us can reach her,
,,
,"that she's still unconscious,",
,which means that she's safe.,
,,
Will,Safe? Here?,
,,
Neets,"Could you explain the whole ""don't look",

,I--,
,,
,"I mean, 'cause I saw him.",

,,
Will,"No, no, no. Jonas explained it.",
,,
,"No, he's like us.",
Nomi,He's sensate.,
,,
,He can only connect with other sensate.,
Will,So she's safe.,
,,
Nomi,Except for the fact that a man that uses,
,"zombies to murder people knows who she is,",
,,
,"the police are looking for her,",
,,
,she's using equipment,
,"that could get her 20 years in prison,",
,,
,all while aiding and abetting,
,her fugitive lover.,

,"Is that what you mean by ""safe""?",

Neets,"Hey, Nom, it's OK.",
