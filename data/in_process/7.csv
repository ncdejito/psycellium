Nomi,This isn't a fair fight.,
,,
,We need to level the playing field,
,and that's what this guy does.,
,,
Neets,And you trust him?,
,,
,Because you were hackers together?,
,,
Nomi,Because he got caught,
,hacking the Pentagon during the war.,
,,
Neets,Couldn't have been very serious.,
,,
Nomi,It was.,
Neets,Then why isn't he in jail?,
,,
Nomi,Because I took the fall for him.,
,,
,I was a juvenile. I had rich parents.,
,I got off with community service.,
,,
,I never told you because I didn't think,
,that I would ever have to revisit,
,,

Neets,Ah.,
Nomi,I figure justice is as justice does.,
,,
,If the government,
,"can use this shit to spy on us,",

Bug,"Missed you, buddy.",

Min-Jung,I married my husband,
,when I was 22 years old.,
,,
,I felt like I was a very lucky woman.,
,,
,Then he lost his job.,
,,
,And he started drinking.,
,,
,And then... beating me.,
,,
,I could guess how bad the beating would be,
,by the hands of the clock.,
,,
,Time was a source of terror.,
,,
,"But in here, every moment",
,spent free of that man is a gift.,
,,
Sun,But... why are you here?,

,"Because that was a guy thing,",
,and this is a romantic restaurant?,
,,
Lito,Exactly.,
,,
Daniela,You worry too much.,

,This is totally working.,
,,
,If a photographer comes up,
,"or someone that wants an autograph,",
,,
,all Hernando has to do,
,"is stand up and glower at them,",
,,
,and I guarantee everyone in this room,
,will believe he's your new bodyguard.,

Daniela,For starters... Lito's never hit me.,
,,
Joaquin,"Wait, that's not fair.",
,,
,This is Mexico. I am a man.,
,,
,I was raised that way.,

Lito,What?,
,,
Joaquin,"I wanna see you fuck her, Lito.",
,,
Daniela,Jesus Christ!,
,,
Joaquin,"I know how it sounds, but please!",
,,
,Give the guy a break.,
,,
,You're the better man. You won.,
,,
,You fucked her away from me.,
,,
,So I just thought maybe I could,
,"learn how to fuck her back,",
,,
,or at least how to fuck the next her,
,away from someone else.,
,,
Daniela,That's it. I'm calling the police.,
Joaquin,"Oh, no, no. Please. No, wait! Hey!",
,,
,"Listen to me. Wait, Dani. Listen to me.",

Nomi,"You know, I still can't believe",
,how you're just taking this all in stride.,
,,
,If someone told me they were hearing,

,I'd be sure they slipped off,
,their medication.,

Grace,Child of the '60s.,
,,
,"If you didn't hear voices at least once,",
,you were doing something wrong.,

Diego,You sure you got the right kid?,

,,
,Lost. A million people around me.,
,,
,"I felt this panic starting to rise up,",

Nomi,Aw.,
Grace,"It was a... a feeling, or a vibration,",
,,
,and I... I followed it straight to her.,
,,
Neets,Waffle cone stand.,

Kala,"From the day I decided to marry Rajan,",
,,
,you have been sending me... visions.,
,,
,You sent me a vision of a woman,
,taking her own life.,

Kala,"I asked him to stop my wedding,",
,and he did.,
,,
Wolfgang,You think he stopped your wedding?,
,,
Kala,Do you have a better explanation?,
,,
Wolfgang,So you think our connection...,
,is a kind of miracle?,
,,
Kala,If I were trying to describe,
,this feeling...,
,,
,the sensation of experiencing,
,"the warmth of the sun,",
,,
,the smell of jasmine and marigold...,
,,
,while at the same time being soaked,
,by a downpour at an outdoor cafÃ©...,

Gunnar,"Playing Beethoven's the same, you know.",

,to talk about the same miracles,
,that faith talks about.,
,,
Wolfgang,"But... one language makes sense,",
,one doesn't.,
,,
Kala,"Sense? What, like quantum physics?",
,,
,Like a particle,
,that can be here and not here?,
,,
,Or sense like gravity?,
,,
,A force that no one knows why exists.,
,,
,Only that if it didn't exist...,
,,
,if there wasn't this,

,,
Silas,I would do anything for her.,
,,
,It's the same with you,
,"and your mother, yes?",

,This one I was grooming,
,to be my number one runner.,
,,
,Do you know what he did?,
