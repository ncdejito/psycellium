,Black market diamonds from Mumbai.,

,I know this because my son,
,had been casing this place for months.,

,"Pickups, deliveries,",
,when the place was empty.,
,,
,Steiner is furious.,
,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",
,,
,And there are few things,
,as unpleasant for me,
,,
,as listening to my own son whine.,
,,
,The interesting part is...,
,the safe was not drilled.,
,,
,No one bored through,
,"to look at the tumblers,",

,poured liquid nitrogen,
,or acid inside.,
,,
,"No, no, no, no. (gentle scoff)",

,Yeah.,
,,
,More interesting still is...,
,that the safe was an S&D.,
,,
,The same kind of safe,
,that fucked your father.,
,,
Wolfgang,Mm.,
,,
Sergei,It would be an irony,
,of Shakespearean proportions,
,,
,if his son fucked his own life,
,,
,cracking the safe his father,
,"failed to crack, wouldn't it?",
,,
Wolfgang,I'm not as stupid as my father.,

Sergei,Wolfgang? Your father made mistakes.,

,I prefer to assume you're a hallucination.,
,,
Capheus,I take no offense.,
,,
Sun,"Since that is resolved,",
,I would like to continue my walk.,
,,
Capheus,Please.,
,,
Sun,Alone.,
Capheus,Of course.,
,,
Sun,You're still here.,
Capheus,I'm sorry.,
,,
,I don't know how I came here,
,or how I go back.,
,,
,Perhaps there is something in me,
,that calls or something in you that calls.,
,,
Sun,I'm not calling you or anyone else.,
,,
Capheus,Perhaps that is the problem.,
,,
,Are you in trouble?,
,,
Sun,No. But tomorrow I might be.,
,,
Capheus,I know this choice.,
,,
,It's like having two different lives.,
,,
,One will be very dangerous for me.,
,,
,"The other, very bad for my mother.",
,,
Sun,"My question is, am I the person",
,"who wants to see my brother punished,",
,,
,who wants to watch the business,
,my father built be destroyed?,
,,
,Or am I the person,
,"who wants to save them,",
,,
,"who will go to prison for them,",
,,
,even though they have been cruel to me,
,for my entire life?,
,,
Capheus,You are afraid.,
,,
,I feel it for my mother every day.,
,,
,I promised I would take care of her.,
,,
,Everything will be all right...,
,,
,I must keep that promise.,
,,
,"I must keep it, no matter what.",
,,
Sun,I promised my mother,
,I would protect my family.,
,,
,It was the last thing I said to her,
,before she died.,
,,
,If I break it--,
Capheus,Then your last words become a lie.,
,,
,"Once, when I was eight...",
,,
,my father's enemies came to our house.,
,,
,"They had big machetes, like this.",
,,
,"My mother had a knife, like this.",
,,
,They wanted revenge,
,for what my father's tribe had done.,
,,
,They wanted me.,
,,
,My father was gone. She was alone.,
,,
,"But... she put me behind her,",
,and she faced these men.,
,,
,They knew they could kill her.,
,,
,But they also looked her,
,in the eyes and knew ,
,,
,she would take,
,at least one of them with her.,
,,
,And they left.,
,,
,Because none of them,
,wanted to be that one.,
,,
,Who can say if it is,
,"we who make the choice,",
,,
,or the choice that makes us?,
