Rajan,Mm.,
,,
,Amazing. Absolutely amazing to me,
,how lives can span generations,

,"in something as simple as a recipe,",

,,
Kala,"By all accounts, great-grandmother",
,"was a very difficult person,",
,,
,"who told my father he was a terrible cook,",

,and hated the way he made,
,the patra ni machhi.,
,,
Rajan,"Well, back then,",
,it must have been very hard,
,,
,for a woman with her obvious talents.,
,,
,"Even today, she would have a hard time",
,,
,getting the same recognition,
,your father gets just because he's a man.,
,,
,"Well, our parents do",
,"the best that they can,",

,and it's our job to forgive them.,
,,
Kala,"Rajan, you're not making this easy,",
,but I think we should just get on with it.,
,,
Rajan,Get on with what?,
Kala,I know why you came here.,
,,
,I know that if it was you that had fainted,
,"just before you were to marry me,",
,,
,"oh, dear, I'd be absolutely sure",
,that you hated me,

,and that you didn't,
,want anything to do with me.,

Rajan,"Kala, please, just listen.",

,I'm here because I'm hoping,
,that it's not the end of our story.,
,,
,"For me, I love what happened.",
,,
,I love it because it makes,
,our wedding something special.,
,,
,Everyone else looks at pictures,
,of their wedding,
,,
,and the story is always the same.,

,But I imagine telling our children,
