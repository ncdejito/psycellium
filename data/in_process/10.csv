Jonas,(Jonas) You look lost.,

Will,Why'd you do that?,
,,
Jonas,Do what?,
Will,Leave.,

Jonas,I told you it was,

,Connections are fragile things.,

Lawyer,It is extraordinary.,
,,
,"I have never experienced anything like it,",
,not in my 20 years since passing the bar.,
,,
,Your father did everything,
,"he said he was going to do, and more...",
,,
,the court agreed to hear his testimony.,
,,
,"If the hearing goes well, I think I can",
,have you out of here in less than a week.,
,,
,You have to agree to the procedure here.,
,,
Sun,What will happen to Joong-Ki?,
,,
Lawyer,(lawyer sighs),
,,
,The court was lenient on you,
,because you cooperated.,
,,
,I suspect...,
,they will make an example of him.,
,,
,If I were your brother...,

,I would be on the next plane,
,to somewhere far from Seoul.,

Steiner,"(Steiner) What's up, Wolfman? Ooh...",
,,
Wolfgang,The fuck are you doing here?,
Steiner,"Down, boy. Down. (tsking)",
,,
,I heard dear Dad came to see you.,
,,
,He said you had yourselves,
,"a real nice... man-to-man,",
,,
,"but, knowing you, cousin, like I do,",
,,
,I figured you needed a little...,
,motivational... TED-type talk?,
,,
,"Now, first of all...",
,,
,I love Felix.,
,,
,It was really hard...,
,to watch what happened to him.,
,,
,Even though I know,
,that he would agree when I say,
,,
,that he did bring it upon himself.,
,,
,But... I am pulling,
,for his total recovery.,
,,
,"In fact, I have some...",
,"close friends that work here,",
,,
,and I asked them,
,to keep an eye on him for me.,
,,
,(chuckles) They did scare me a little,
,,
,with all the talk,
,about the things that can go wrong,
,,
,when someone like Felix,
,is trying to recover.,
,,
,"Like, they had one case recently",
,,
,"where someone got the wrong medicine,",
,and boom! (whispers) Dead.,
,,
,Would be some kinda... bad luck,

Jonas,It's Independence Day?,
Will,Yeah.,
,,
Jonas,My parents were from India.,
,,
,"I was born there, but they moved to London",
,when I was a baby.,
,,
,"In my 20s, I moved to New York.",
,,
,I never fully grasped,
,where I owed my allegiance.,
,,
,Didn't know what I was supposed to sing.,
,,
,The Indian national anthem? America's?,
,,
,"""God Save the Queen""?",
,,
,I envy people their clear-cut allegiances.,
,,
Will,"Yeah, my dad's like that.",
,,
,"One beer, he's hammering the world",
,"into two different sides,",
,,
,"Bears or Packers, us or them.",
,,
Jonas,He's more right than he knows.,
,,
Will,"When you said that we're not like them,",
,did you mean we're not human?,
,,
Jonas,What is human?,
,,
,An ability to reason? To imagine?,
,To love or grieve?,
,,
,"If so, we are more human",
,than any human ever will be.,

Sanyam,What troubles you?,
,,
,It's all right.,
,,
,Say what's on your mind.,
,,
Kala,For some time now...,
,,
,I've been... confused about the wedding.,
,,
Sanyam,I know.,
,,
Kala,The police wanted to know,
,why Papa-ji was at the temple.,
,,
Sanyam,"Since he's a non-believer,",
,I assume to see you.,
,,
,Did he tell you why?,
,,
Kala,Manendra said that...,
,he was reconsidering our marriage.,
,,
Sanyam,Ah... I see.,
,,
,So did you tell the police?,
,,
Kala,No.,
,,
Sanyam,Why not?,
Kala,Because I haven't told Rajan.,
,,
Sanyam,Because you are,
,still confused about the wedding.,
,,
Kala,More confused than ever.,
,,
Sanyam,"Well, you have to wonder,",
,"if Manendra changed his mind,",
,,
,why did he come to you,
,instead of his own son?,
,,
,Perhaps because he knew,
,his own son wouldn't listen to him.,
,,
,"This was a love marriage, after all.",
,,
,But it's possible that Rajan,
,will now have a different reaction,
,,
,if it turns out that,
,this is his father's very last wish.,
,,
,"By telling Rajan now,",
,"you will actually empower his father,",
,,
,giving him more control over Rajan's life,
,than he had while he was alive.,
,,
,(sighs) Interesting.,
,,
,The simple solution,
,would be to tell the truth...,
,,
,and let the chips fall where they may.,
,,
,But if this marriage,
,holds the possible future,
,,
,"of a long and happy life together,",
,,
,is it right to let a dominating man,
,take that away from you?,
,,
,"And yet, to not tell Rajan is to build...",
,whatever happiness you might find,
,,
,upon a secret.,
,,
,(sighs softly),
,,
,"Not an easy decision, to be sure...",
,,
,but one that I know,
,you already have the answer for.,

Jonas,Years ago... I was on your side,
,"of this conversation,",
,,
,and the man in my place,
,was the father of our cluster.,
,,
,He was telling me all sorts of bullshit,
,"about the psycellium,",
,,
,about how he could feel,
,from this present moment,
,,
,all the way back to the first breath,
,his cluster ever took.,
,,
,He was telling me,
,what it meant to be sensate.,
,,
Will,But I-- I don't understand,
,how they never found me out.,
,,
,"I've had x-rays, MRIs, blood tests...",
,,
Jonas,The differences are very subtle.,
,,
,"Understand, we are closer to humankind",
,than the bonobo is to a baboon.,
,,
,You've gotta know what you're looking for.,
,Evolution is frugal in her variation.,
,,
,One small chromosome here or there,
,and you walk on two legs instead of four.,
,,
Will,But I look the same.,
,I feel the same.,
,,
Jonas,Really?,
Will,In most ways.,
,,
Jonas,You mean when you're not,
,sharing your most private thoughts,
,,
,with someone,
,on the other side of the world?,

,(no audio from TV),
,,
Kala,You're Capheus.,
,,
,I'm Kala.,
,,
Capheus,You are beautiful.,
,,
Kala,Thank you.,
,,
,Do you mind if I...?,
Capheus,"Please, sit.",
,,
Kala,That is a very large television.,
Capheus,"Ah, yes. (chuckles)",
,,
,"Samsung SMT-4023, 42 inches.",
,,
,"Best value, color space, and resolution.",
,,
Kala,(chuckles),
,,
,Can I ask you a question?,
Capheus,Of course.,
,,
Kala,The first time I went,
,into a house like this in Bombay...,
,,
,"they had no beds,",
,but they had a television as big as this.,
,,
,"I mean, how can a TV",
,be more important than a bed?,
,,
Capheus,Ah... That's simple.,
,,
,The bed keeps you in a slum.,
,,
,The flat screen takes you out.,
,,
Kala,Ah...,
Capheus,Eh.,
,,
,(Kala chuckles),
,(no audio from TV),
,,
Kala,What are you watching?,
Capheus,Lionheart.,
,,
Kala,Never heard of it.,
Capheus,Really?,
,,
,(Kala chuckles),
,Ah!,
,,
Kala,Does it have any dancing in it?,
,,
Capheus,Jean-Claude is the Fred Astaire...,
,of martial arts.,
,,
Kala,Ah... I love Fred Astaire.,
,,
Capheus,Lionheart is the first movie that,
,made me fall in love with Jean-Claude.,
,,
,I watch it any time,
,I need to find courage.,
,,
Kala,I could use some courage right now.,
,,
,(microwave beeps),

,(crowd clapping on TV),
,(Kala groans),
,,
Van Damme,(man) Lionheart!,
,(fighter grunting),
,,
,(Kala groans),
,,
Kala,I thought you said,
,this film had dancing in it.,
,,
Capheus,This is dancing.,
,,
Kala,It's so violent.,
,,
Capheus,Life is violent.,
,,
Kala,It is.,
,,
,I didn't think so before.,
,,
Capheus,But you do now.,

Jonas,(Jonas) Watch a flock of birds,
,or a shoal of fish move as one...,
,,
,and you glimpse where we came from.,
,,
,Ask how aspen trees feel trauma,
,"hundreds of miles apart,",
,,
,or how a mushroom,
,can understand the needs of a forest...,
,,
,you'd begin to grasp what we are.,
,,
,Our kind has been here,
,since the beginning.,
,,
,"In all likelihood, we were the beginning.",
,,
,What I want... is to make sure,
,we're there at the end.,
,,
Will,But if there's another species,
,"of Homo sapien, how can it be a secret?",
,,
Jonas,Secrets are important to their species.,
,,
,Secrets are the center,
,"of their identities, of their societies.",
,,
,Secrets maintain their hierarchies.,
,,
,"To reveal this secret,",
,"that there is another kind of human,",
,,
,one whose existence threatens,
,the very fundament of their reality...,
,,
,No... they'll never allow that.,
,,
Will,"Do you have a secret, Jonas?",
,,
Jonas,"You're a good cop, aren't you?",
,,
,They're gonna try to use me to get to you,
,and the rest of your cluster.,
,,
Will,"The one who came for Nomi, Dr. Matheson?",
,,
Jonas,He uses many names.,
,,
Whispers,(man whispers) Jonas...,
Jonas,Angelica called him Whispers.,
,,
,Never look him in the eye.,
,,
,Never.,
,,
Will,Angelica.,
,,
,That's why she killed herself.,
,,
,To protect us.,
,,
Jonas,My father told me something,
,that always stayed with me.,
,,
,It's probably what kept me alive.,
,,
,"He said that what made us ""us""",
,,
,was far less important,
,"than what makes them ""them.""",
,,
,"In the end,",
,it doesn't matter who came first.,
,,
,All that matters is the fact,
,that one small chromosomal mutation,
,,
,severed them from their connection,
,"to nature, and to each other.",
,,
,That isolation has allowed them,
,to focus on the one thing they do better,
,,
,than any species in history.,
,,
,Killing is easy...,
,when you can feel nothing.,

Henchman 1,Search him.,
Henchman 2,I just did.,
,,
Steiner,Search him again!,
,,
,"He's a fucking smart guy,",
,"aren't you, Wolfie?",
,,
,"He knows all the tricks, so fucking smart.",
,,
Henchman 2,Just found that.,

Steiner,Open it. Could be wired.,
,,
,Open it!,
,,
,(exhales softly),
,,
,(softly) Yeah! (laughs),
,,
,(whistles),
,,
,So fucking smart. You think Felix,
,would think you're so fucking smart now?,
,,
Wolfgang,You got what you wanted.,
,,
Steiner,I wanna know something.,
,How did you do it?,
,,
,"When I walked in, the safe was clean.",
,,
,I spent two hours cutting it open.,
,,
,Tell me... how you did it.,
,,
Wolfgang,I cracked it.,
,,
Steiner,You cracked it?,
,,
,Like... in the movies?,
,,
,Listening to the tumblers,
,with your stethoscope?,
,,
,You just cracked it?!,
,,
,"Fucking smart guy, right here!",
,,
,First guy in history,
,to fuck the pants off an S&D safe.,
,,
,Huh?,
,,
,(grunts),
,,
,Is that really,
,what you expect me to believe?,
,,
,You think I'm that fucking stupid?,
,,
,Huh?!,
,(grunts),
,,
,Oh. Is that what you think?,
,,
,"You think I'm stupid, huh?",
,,
,"Hey, Wolfie, where you going?",
,,
,You haven't answered my question yet.,
,,
,Answer my fucking question.,
,,
,You think I'm stupid?,
,That what you think? Huh?!,
,,
Wolfgang,(exhales) No.,
,,
Steiner,"Well, OK.",
,,
,First smart thing you said.,
,,
,Now... tell me the fucking truth,
,or I'll blow your smart-guy brains,
,,
,all over the fucking street!,
,,
Lito,You knew everything.,
,,
,"You knew he would hit you,",
,you knew you would fall to the ground.,
,,
,But he kicked you and drove you,
,away from the gun. You were really close.,
,,
Wolfgang,All I needed was a little space.,
,,
Lito,Why don't you just...,
,tell him something he wants to hear?,
,,
,Tell him... Tell him...,
,,
,"I don't know, just a little lie",
,that will make him relax and then we--,
,,
,we'll figure it out.,
,,
Wolfgang,I can't.,
,,
Lito,Why?,
,,
Wolfgang,He reminds me of my father.,
,,
Lito,Just a little lie.,
,,
,OK. May I?,
,,
,Do you mind?,
,,
Steiner,(Steiner) Did you hear me?!,
,,
,Tell me the fucking truth. (panting),
,,
,(screams) Tell me!,
,,
,(Steiner grunts),
,,
Lito,It was Felix. It was Felix.,
,,
,He found out... the Indian liked boys.,
,,
,"Ran into him at a club,",
,fed him some drinks.,
,,
Steiner,(Steiner giggling),
Lito,Felix got the combination from him.,
,,
Steiner,I knew it! I fucking knew it!,
,,
,Fucking Felix!,
,,
,(chuckles) I bet he sucked his cock!,
,,
,There had to be,
,some cock-sucking involved.,
,,
,"He sucked his cock, didn't he?",
,,
,(sighs),
,,
Lito,He did what he had to do.,
,,
Steiner,Ooh! Cock-sucking Felix!,
,,
,(laughing),
,,
,Look! Look at this.,
,,
,Would any of you suck cock for this?,
,,
Henchman 1,Sure.,
,,
Steiner,That's why you and cock-sucking Felix,
,"and Wolfie are all fucking idiots,",
,,
,and I'm the only one,
,with some fucking brains here!,
,,
Henchman 1,What?!,
,,
,(machine gun fire),
,,
,(machine gun fire),
,,
Steiner,You're fucking dead!,

,You and your cock-sucking friend,

,What the fuck?!,

,Fuck!,

Lito,Fucking hell!,
,,
,That's what I'm talking about!,
,,
,"Fucking hell, man.",
,,
,What the fuck is that?,

Wolfgang,Thank you.,
,,
Lito,Lying is easy.,
,,
,It's what I do.,

Riley,Yrsa said the same thing.,

Will,Will you please be careful?,

Riley,"Yrsa said something else, too.",
